Method: jobs.getQueryResults
bookmark_border
RPC to get the results of a query job.
HTTP request
GET https://bigquery.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}/queries/{jobId}
The URL uses gRPC Transcoding [https://google.aip.dev/127] syntax.
Path parameters
Parameters
projectId
string
Required. Project ID of the query job.
jobId
string
Required. Job ID of the query job.
Query parameters
Parameters
startIndex
string (UInt64Value [https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format] format)
Zero-based index of the starting row.
pageToken
string
Page token, returned by a previous call, to request the next page of results.
maxResults
integer
Maximum number of results to read.
timeoutMs
integer
Optional: Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client is willing to wait for the query to complete. By default, this limit is 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds). If the query is complete, the jobComplete field in the response is true. If the query has not yet completed, jobComplete is false.
You can request a longer timeout period in the timeoutMs field. However, the call is not guaranteed to wait for the specified timeout; it typically returns after around 200 seconds (200,000 milliseconds), even if the query is not complete.
If jobComplete is false, you can continue to wait for the query to complete by calling the getQueryResults method until the jobComplete field in the getQueryResults response is true.
location
string
The geographic location of the job. You must specify the location to run the job for the following scenarios:
If the location to run a job is not in the us or the eu multi-regional location
If the job's location is in a single region (for example, us-central1)
For more information, see how to specify locations.
formatOptions
object (DataFormatOptions [https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/DataFormatOptions])
Optional. Output format adjustments.
Request body
The request body must be empty.
Response body
Response object of jobs.getQueryResults.
If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:
JSON representation

```
{
  "kind": string,
  "etag": string,
  "schema": {
    object (TableSchema)
  },
  "jobReference": {
    object (JobReference [https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/JobReference])
  },
  "totalRows": string,
  "pageToken": string,
  "rows": [
    {
      object
    }
  ],
  "totalBytesProcessed": string,
  "jobComplete": boolean,
  "errors": [
    {
      object (ErrorProto)
    }
  ],
  "cacheHit": boolean,
  "numDmlAffectedRows": string
}
```

Fields
kind
string
The resource type of the response.
etag
string
A hash of this response.
schema
object (TableSchema)
The schema of the results. Present only when the query completes successfully.
jobReference
object (JobReference [https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/JobReference])
Reference to the BigQuery Job that was created to run the query. This field will be present even if the original request timed out, in which case jobs.getQueryResults can be used to read the results once the query has completed. Since this API only returns the first page of results, subsequent pages can be fetched via the same mechanism (jobs.getQueryResults).
totalRows
string (UInt64Value [https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format] format)
The total number of rows in the complete query result set, which can be more than the number of rows in this single page of results. Present only when the query completes successfully.
pageToken
string
A token used for paging results. When this token is non-empty, it indicates additional results are available.
rows[]
object (Struct format)
An object with as many results as can be contained within the maximum permitted reply size. To get any additional rows, you can call jobs.getQueryResults and specify the jobReference returned above. Present only when the query completes successfully.
The REST-based representation of this data leverages a series of JSON f,v objects for indicating fields and values.
totalBytesProcessed
string (Int64Value [https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format] format)
The total number of bytes processed for this query.
jobComplete
boolean
Whether the query has completed or not. If rows or totalRows are present, this will always be true. If this is false, totalRows will not be available.
errors[]
object (ErrorProto)
Output only. The first errors or warnings encountered during the running of the job. The final message includes the number of errors that caused the process to stop. Errors here do not necessarily mean that the job has completed or was unsuccessful. For more information about error messages, see Error messages [https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/error-messages].
cacheHit
boolean
Whether the query result was fetched from the query cache.
numDmlAffectedRows
string (Int64Value [https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format] format)
Output only. The number of rows affected by a DML statement. Present only for DML statements INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE.
