BigQuery Migration Service audit logging

This document describes audit logging for BigQuery Migration Service. Google Cloud services generate audit logs that record administrative and access activities within your Google Cloud resources. For more information about Cloud Audit Logs, see the following:
Types of audit logs [https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#types]
Audit log entry structure [https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#audit_log_entry_structure]

Service name
BigQuery Migration Service audit logs use the service name bigquerymigration.googleapis.com. Filter for this service:
    protoPayload.serviceName="bigquerymigration.googleapis.com"
  
Methods by permission type
Each IAM permission has a type property, whose value is an enum that can be one of four values: ADMIN_READ, ADMIN_WRITE, DATA_READ, or DATA_WRITE. When you call a method, BigQuery Migration Service generates an audit log whose category is dependent on the type property of the permission required to perform the method. Methods that require an IAM permission with the type property value of DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE, or ADMIN_READ generate Data Access [https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#data-access] audit logs. Methods that require an IAM permission with the type property value of ADMIN_WRITE generate Admin Activity [https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#admin-activity] audit logs.
