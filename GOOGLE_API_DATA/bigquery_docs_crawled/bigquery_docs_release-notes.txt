This new capability uses BigQuery object tables to access image data stored in Cloud Storage and predict results from machine learning models. You can now generate insights from structured and unstructured data with the following steps:
Create an object table to access images stored in Cloud Storage.
Import vision models in TensorFlow vision models such as ImageNet [https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v3_small_075_224/feature_vector/5] or ResNet 50 [https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/resnet_50/classification/1], or import your own models to detect objects from images, to annotate photos, and to perform OCR.
Unify image data with structured data such as user activities or sales orders to train machine learning models. You can then use prediction results to extract insights from your data.

The BigQuery service is being renamed from:
bigquery-json.googleapis.com
to
bigquery.googleapis.com.
bigquery-json.googleapis.com will become an alias of bigquery.googleapis.com going forward.
This change is largely transparent to users and does not affect runtime traffic or management operations. Risks and mitigation are discussed below.
Calls to the BigQuery API will not be affected.
Timing
The change is a two phase process that we plan to release during November and December 2019.
Impact when using Service Management and Service Usage APIs
Responses from the Service Management API [https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/overview] and the Service Usage API [https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/overview] for information about the BigQuery service will contain information about bigquery.googleapis.com, even when you request data for bigquery-json.googleapis.com. Other than the name, the responses from the Service Management API and the Service Usage API will be the same. For example, listing enabled services will now return bigquery.googleapis.com, instead of bigquery-json.googleapis.com.
Risks and Mitigation
During the week of the second phase, alerts on Stackdriver Transparent Service Level Indicators [https://cloud.google.com/transparent-sli/] (SLIs) for the bigquery-json.googleapis.com will break. Users should add a duplicate alert for bigquery.googleapis.com. The following are the serviceruntime [https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-serviceruntime] SLIs where you now need to use bigquery.googleapis.com:
serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/request_count
serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/request_latencies
serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/request_latencies_backend
serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/request_latencies_overhead
serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/request_sizes
serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/response_sizes
The Google provider for Terraform has been updated to use the new name, bigquery.googleapis.com. Terraform users should upgrade to a Google provider with version >= 2.17.0 before November 4, 2019.
