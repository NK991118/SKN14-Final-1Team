Method: projects.list
bookmark_border
RPC to list projects to which the user has been granted any project role.
Users of this method are encouraged to consider the Resource Manager [https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/] API, which provides the underlying data for this method and has more capabilities.
HTTP request
GET https://bigquery.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2/projects
The URL uses gRPC Transcoding [https://google.aip.dev/127] syntax.
Query parameters
Parameters
maxResults
integer
maxResults unset returns all results, up to 50 per page. Additionally, the number of projects in a page may be fewer than maxResults because projects are retrieved and then filtered to only projects with the BigQuery API enabled.
pageToken
string
Page token, returned by a previous call, to request the next page of results. If not present, no further pages are present.
Request body
The request body must be empty.
Response body

object (ProjectReference [https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/ProjectReference])

projects[].friendlyName
string
A descriptive name for this project. A wrapper is used here because friendlyName can be set to the empty string.
