A set of field paths on a document. Used to restrict a get or update operation on a document to a subset of its fields. This is different from standard field masks, as this is always scoped to a Document [https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.databases.documents#Document], and takes in account the dynamic nature of Value [https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/reference/rest/Shared.Types/ArrayValue#Value].
