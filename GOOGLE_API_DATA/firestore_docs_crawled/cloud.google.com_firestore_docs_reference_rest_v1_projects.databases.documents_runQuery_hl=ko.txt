Path parameters
| Parameters |
| --- |
| parent | string Required. The parent resource name. In the format: projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/documents or projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/documents/{document_path}. For example: projects/my-project/databases/my-database/documents or projects/my-project/databases/my-database/documents/chatrooms/my-chatroom |

Request body
The request body contains data with the following structure:

| JSON representation |
| --- |
| {   "explainOptions": {     object (ExplainOptions)   },    // Union field query_type can be only one of the following:   "structuredQuery": {     object (StructuredQuery)   }   // End of list of possible types for union field query_type.    // Union field consistency_selector can be only one of the following:   "transaction": string,   "newTransaction": {     object (TransactionOptions)   },   "readTime": string   // End of list of possible types for union field consistency_selector. } |

| Fields |
| --- |
| explainOptions | object (ExplainOptions) Optional. Explain options for the query. If set, additional query statistics will be returned. If not, only query results will be returned. |
| Union field query_type. The query to run. query_type can be only one of the following: |
| structuredQuery | object (StructuredQuery) A structured query. |
| Union field consistency_selector. The consistency mode for this transaction. If not set, defaults to strong consistency. consistency_selector can be only one of the following: |
| transaction | string (bytes format) Run the query within an already active transaction. The value here is the opaque transaction ID to execute the query in. A base64-encoded string. |
| newTransaction | object (TransactionOptions) Starts a new transaction and reads the documents. Defaults to a read-only transaction. The new transaction ID will be returned as the first response in the stream. |
| readTime | string (Timestamp format) Reads documents as they were at the given time. This must be a microsecond precision timestamp within the past one hour, or if Point-in-Time Recovery is enabled, can additionally be a whole minute timestamp within the past 7 days. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and uses 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z", "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30". |

Response body

The response for Firestore.RunQuery [https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.databases.documents/runQuery#google.firestore.v1.Firestore.RunQuery].
If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:

| JSON representation |
| --- |
| {   "transaction": string,   "document": {     object (Document)   },   "readTime": string,   "skippedResults": integer,   "explainMetrics": {     object (ExplainMetrics)   },    // Union field continuation_selector can be only one of the following:   "done": boolean   // End of list of possible types for union field continuation_selector. } |

| Fields |
| --- |
| transaction | string (bytes format) The transaction that was started as part of this request. Can only be set in the first response, and only if RunQueryRequest.new_transaction was set in the request. If set, no other fields will be set in this response. A base64-encoded string. |
| document | object (Document) A query result, not set when reporting partial progress. |
| readTime | string (Timestamp format) The time at which the document was read. This may be monotonically increasing; in this case, the previous documents in the result stream are guaranteed not to have changed between their readTime and this one. If the query returns no results, a response with readTime and no document will be sent, and this represents the time at which the query was run. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and uses 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z", "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30". |
| skippedResults | integer The number of results that have been skipped due to an offset between the last response and the current response. |
| explainMetrics | object (ExplainMetrics) Query explain metrics. This is only present when the RunQueryRequest.explain_options is provided, and it is sent only once with the last response in the stream. |
| Union field continuation_selector. The continuation mode for the query. If present, it indicates the current query response stream has finished. This can be set with or without a document present, but when set, no more results are returned. continuation_selector can be only one of the following: |
| done | boolean If present, Firestore has completely finished the request and no more documents will be returned. |
