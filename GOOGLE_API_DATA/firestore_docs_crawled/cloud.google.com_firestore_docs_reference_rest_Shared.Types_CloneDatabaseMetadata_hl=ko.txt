PitrSnapshot

A consistent snapshot of a database at a specific point in time. A PITR (Point-in-time recovery) snapshot with previous versions of a database's data is available for every minute up to the associated database's data retention period. If the PITR feature is enabled, the retention period is 7 days; otherwise, it is one hour.
