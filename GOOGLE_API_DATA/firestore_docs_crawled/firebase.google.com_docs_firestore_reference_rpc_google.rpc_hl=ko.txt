Status [https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/reference/rpc/google.rpc#google.rpc.Status] (message)

Each Status message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the API Design Guide [https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors].
