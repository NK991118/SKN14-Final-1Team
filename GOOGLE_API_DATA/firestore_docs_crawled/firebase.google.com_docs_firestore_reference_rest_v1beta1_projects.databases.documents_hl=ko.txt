Resource: Document

A Firestore document.Must not exceed 1 MiB - 4 bytes.

| JSON representation |
| --- |
| {   "name": string,   "fields": {     string: {       object (Value)     },     ...   },   "createTime": string,   "updateTime": string } |

| Fields |
| --- |
| name | string The resource name of the document, for example projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/documents/{document_path}. |
| fields | map (key: string, value: object (Value)) The document's fields. The map keys represent field names. Field names matching the regular expression __.*__ are reserved. Reserved field names are forbidden except in certain documented contexts. The field names, represented as UTF-8, must not exceed 1,500 bytes and cannot be empty. Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to structured fields defined here. For mapValue, the field path is represented by a dot-delimited (.) string of segments. Each segment is either a simple field name (defined below) or a quoted field name. For example, the structured field "foo" : { mapValue: { "x&y" : { stringValue: "hello" }}} would be represented by the field path foo.`x&y`. A simple field name contains only characters a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, or _, and must not start with 0 to 9. For example, foo_bar_17. A quoted field name starts and ends with ` and may contain any character. Some characters, including `, must be escaped using a \. For example, `x&y` represents x&y and `bak\`tik` represents bak`tik. An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }. |
| createTime | string (Timestamp format) Output only. The time at which the document was created. This value increases monotonically when a document is deleted then recreated. It can also be compared to values from other documents and the readTime of a query. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and uses 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z", "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30". |
| updateTime | string (Timestamp format) Output only. The time at which the document was last changed. This value is initially set to the createTime then increases monotonically with each change to the document. It can also be compared to values from other documents and the readTime of a query. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and uses 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z", "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30". |
