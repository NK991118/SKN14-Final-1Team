Resource: Index

Cloud Firestore indexes enable simple and complex queries against documents in a database.

| JSON representation |
| --- |
| {   "name": string,   "queryScope": enum (QueryScope),   "fields": [     {       object (IndexField)     }   ],   "state": enum (State) } |

| Fields |
| --- |
| name | string Output only. A server defined name for this index. The form of this name for composite indexes will be: projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/collectionGroups/{collectionId}/indexes/{composite_index_id} For single field indexes, this field will be empty. |
| queryScope | enum (QueryScope) Indexes with a collection query scope specified allow queries against a collection that is the child of a specific document, specified at query time, and that has the same collection id. Indexes with a collection group query scope specified allow queries against all collections descended from a specific document, specified at query time, and that have the same collection id as this index. |
| fields[] | object (IndexField) The fields supported by this index. For composite indexes, this is always 2 or more fields. The last field entry is always for the field path __name__. If, on creation, __name__ was not specified as the last field, it will be added automatically with the same direction as that of the last field defined. If the final field in a composite index is not directional, the __name__ will be ordered ASCENDING (unless explicitly specified). For single field indexes, this will always be exactly one entry with a field path equal to the field path of the associated field. |
| state | enum (State) Output only. The serving state of the index. |

| Methods |
| --- |
| create | Creates a composite index. |
| delete | Deletes a composite index. |
| get | Gets a composite index. |
| list | Lists composite indexes. |
