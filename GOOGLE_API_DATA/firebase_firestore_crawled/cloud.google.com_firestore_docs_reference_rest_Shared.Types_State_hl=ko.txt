The state of an index. During index creation, an index will be in the CREATING state. If the index is created successfully, it will transition to the READY state. If the index creation encounters a problem, the index will transition to the NEEDS_REPAIR state.

| Enums |
| --- |
| STATE_UNSPECIFIED | The state is unspecified. |
| CREATING | The index is being created. There is an active long-running operation for the index. The index is updated when writing a document. Some index data may exist. |
| READY | The index is ready to be used. The index is updated when writing a document. The index is fully populated from all stored documents it applies to. |
| NEEDS_REPAIR | The index was being created, but something went wrong. There is no active long-running operation for the index, and the most recently finished long-running operation failed. The index is not updated when writing a document. Some index data may exist. Use the google.longrunning.Operations API to determine why the operation that last attempted to create this index failed, then re-create the index. |
