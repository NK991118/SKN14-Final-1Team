BitSequence

A sequence of bits, encoded in a byte array.Each byte in the bitmap byte array stores 8 bits of the sequence. The only exception is the last byte, which may store 8 or fewer bits. The padding defines the number of bits of the last byte to be ignored as "padding". The values of these "padding" bits are unspecified and must be ignored.To retrieve the first bit, bit 0, calculate: (bitmap[0] & 0x01) != 0. To retrieve the second bit, bit 1, calculate: (bitmap[0] & 0x02) != 0. To retrieve the third bit, bit 2, calculate: (bitmap[0] & 0x04) != 0. To retrieve the fourth bit, bit 3, calculate: (bitmap[0] & 0x08) != 0. To retrieve bit n, calculate: (bitmap[n / 8] & (0x01 << (n % 8))) != 0.The "size" of a BitSequence (the number of bits it contains) is calculated by this formula: (bitmap.length * 8) - padding.

| Fields |

BloomFilter

A bloom filter (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter)].The bloom filter hashes the entries with MD5 and treats the resulting 128-bit hash as 2 distinct 64-bit hash values, interpreted as unsigned integers using 2's complement encoding.These two hash values, named h1 and h2, are then used to compute the hash_count hash values using the formula, starting at i=0:
h(i) = h1 + (i * h2)

These resulting values are then taken modulo the number of bits in the bloom filter to get the bits of the bloom filter to test for the given entry.

FieldTransform

A transformation of a field of the document.

| Fields |
| --- |
| field_path | string The path of the field. See Document.fields for the field path syntax reference. |
| Union field transform_type. The transformation to apply on the field. transform_type can be only one of the following: |
| set_to_server_value | ServerValue Sets the field to the given server value. |
| increment | Value Adds the given value to the field's current value. This must be an integer or a double value. If the field is not an integer or double, or if the field does not yet exist, the transformation will set the field to the given value. If either of the given value or the current field value are doubles, both values will be interpreted as doubles. Double arithmetic and representation of double values follow IEEE 754 semantics. If there is positive/negative integer overflow, the field is resolved to the largest magnitude positive/negative integer. |
| maximum | Value Sets the field to the maximum of its current value and the given value. This must be an integer or a double value. If the field is not an integer or double, or if the field does not yet exist, the transformation will set the field to the given value. If a maximum operation is applied where the field and the input value are of mixed types (that is - one is an integer and one is a double) the field takes on the type of the larger operand. If the operands are equivalent (e.g. 3 and 3.0), the field does not change. 0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero. The maximum of a zero stored value and zero input value is always the stored value. The maximum of any numeric value x and NaN is NaN. |
| minimum | Value Sets the field to the minimum of its current value and the given value. This must be an integer or a double value. If the field is not an integer or double, or if the field does not yet exist, the transformation will set the field to the input value. If a minimum operation is applied where the field and the input value are of mixed types (that is - one is an integer and one is a double) the field takes on the type of the smaller operand. If the operands are equivalent (e.g. 3 and 3.0), the field does not change. 0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero. The minimum of a zero stored value and zero input value is always the stored value. The minimum of any numeric value x and NaN is NaN. |
| append_missing_elements | ArrayValue Append the given elements in order if they are not already present in the current field value. If the field is not an array, or if the field does not yet exist, it is first set to the empty array. Equivalent numbers of different types (e.g. 3L and 3.0) are considered equal when checking if a value is missing. NaN is equal to NaN, and Null is equal to Null. If the input contains multiple equivalent values, only the first will be considered. The corresponding transform_result will be the null value. |
| remove_all_from_array | ArrayValue Remove all of the given elements from the array in the field. If the field is not an array, or if the field does not yet exist, it is set to the empty array. Equivalent numbers of the different types (e.g. 3L and 3.0) are considered equal when deciding whether an element should be removed. NaN is equal to NaN, and Null is equal to Null. This will remove all equivalent values if there are duplicates. The corresponding transform_result will be the null value. |

ServerValue

A value that is calculated by the server.

| Enums |
| --- |
| SERVER_VALUE_UNSPECIFIED | Unspecified. This value must not be used. |

ExistenceFilter

A digest of all the documents that match a given target.

| Fields |
| --- |
| target_id | int32 The target ID to which this filter applies. |
| count | int32 The total count of documents that match target_id. If different from the count of documents in the client that match, the client must manually determine which documents no longer match the target. The client can use the unchanged_names bloom filter to assist with this determination by testing ALL the document names against the filter; if the document name is NOT in the filter, it means the document no longer matches the target. |
| unchanged_names | BloomFilter A bloom filter that, despite its name, contains the UTF-8 byte encodings of the resource names of ALL the documents that match target_id, in the form projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}. This bloom filter may be omitted at the server's discretion, such as if it is deemed that the client will not make use of it or if it is too computationally expensive to calculate or transmit. Clients must gracefully handle this field being absent by falling back to the logic used before this field existed; that is, re-add the target without a resume token to figure out which documents in the client's cache are out of sync. |

ExplainMetrics

StructuredAggregationQuery

Firestore query for running an aggregation over a StructuredQuery [https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/reference/rpc/google.firestore.v1beta1#google.firestore.v1beta1.StructuredQuery].

| Fields |
| --- |
| aggregations[] | Aggregation Optional. Series of aggregations to apply over the results of the structured_query. Requires: A minimum of one and maximum of five aggregations per query. |
| Union field query_type. The base query to aggregate over. query_type can be only one of the following: |
| structured_query | StructuredQuery Nested structured query. |

Aggregation

Defines an aggregation that produces a single result.

| Fields |
| --- |
| alias | string Optional. Optional name of the field to store the result of the aggregation into. If not provided, Firestore will pick a default name following the format field_<incremental_id++>. For example: AGGREGATE   COUNT_UP_TO(1) AS count_up_to_1,   COUNT_UP_TO(2),   COUNT_UP_TO(3) AS count_up_to_3,   COUNT(*) OVER (   ... ); becomes: AGGREGATE   COUNT_UP_TO(1) AS count_up_to_1,   COUNT_UP_TO(2) AS field_1,   COUNT_UP_TO(3) AS count_up_to_3,   COUNT(*) AS field_2 OVER (   ... ); Requires: Must be unique across all aggregation aliases. Conform to document field name limitations. |
| Union field operator. The type of aggregation to perform, required. operator can be only one of the following: |
| count | Count Count aggregator. |
| sum | Sum Sum aggregator. |
| avg | Avg Average aggregator. |

Avg

Average of the values of the requested field.

Only numeric values will be aggregated. All non-numeric values including NULL are skipped.
If the aggregated values contain NaN, returns NaN. Infinity math follows IEEE-754 standards.
If the aggregated value set is empty, returns NULL.
Always returns the result as a double.

| Fields |
| --- |
| field | FieldReference The field to aggregate on. |

Count

Count of documents that match the query.The COUNT(*) aggregation function operates on the entire document so it does not require a field reference.

| Fields |
| --- |
| up_to | Int64Value Optional. Optional constraint on the maximum number of documents to count. This provides a way to set an upper bound on the number of documents to scan, limiting latency, and cost. Unspecified is interpreted as no bound. High-Level Example: AGGREGATE COUNT_UP_TO(1000) OVER ( SELECT * FROM k ); Requires: Must be greater than zero when present. |

Sum

Sum of the values of the requested field.

Only numeric values will be aggregated. All non-numeric values including NULL are skipped.
If the aggregated values contain NaN, returns NaN. Infinity math follows IEEE-754 standards.
If the aggregated value set is empty, returns 0.
Returns a 64-bit integer if all aggregated numbers are integers and the sum result does not overflow. Otherwise, the result is returned as a double. Note that even if all the aggregated values are integers, the result is returned as a double if it cannot fit within a 64-bit signed integer. When this occurs, the returned value will lose precision.
When underflow occurs, floating-point aggregation is non-deterministic. This means that running the same query repeatedly without any changes to the underlying values could produce slightly different results each time. In those cases, values should be stored as integers over floating-point numbers.

| Fields |
| --- |
| field | FieldReference The field to aggregate on. |

StructuredQuery

A Firestore query.The query stages are executed in the following order: 1. from 2. where 3. select 4. order_by + start_at + end_at 5. offset 6. limit 7. find_nearest

| Fields |
| --- |
| select | Projection Optional sub-set of the fields to return. This acts as a DocumentMask over the documents returned from a query. When not set, assumes that the caller wants all fields returned. |
| from[] | CollectionSelector The collections to query. |
| where | Filter The filter to apply. |
| order_by[] | Order The order to apply to the query results. Firestore allows callers to provide a full ordering, a partial ordering, or no ordering at all. In all cases, Firestore guarantees a stable ordering through the following rules: The order_by is required to reference all fields used with an inequality filter. All fields that are required to be in the order_by but are not already present are appended in lexicographical ordering of the field name. If an order on __name__ is not specified, it is appended by default. Fields are appended with the same sort direction as the last order specified, or 'ASCENDING' if no order was specified. For example: ORDER BY a becomes ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC ORDER BY a DESC becomes ORDER BY a DESC, __name__ DESC WHERE a > 1 becomes WHERE a > 1 ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC WHERE __name__ > ... AND a > 1 becomes WHERE __name__ > ... AND a > 1 ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC |
| start_at | Cursor A potential prefix of a position in the result set to start the query at. The ordering of the result set is based on the ORDER BY clause of the original query. SELECT * FROM k WHERE a = 1 AND b > 2 ORDER BY b ASC, __name__ ASC; This query's results are ordered by (b ASC, __name__ ASC). Cursors can reference either the full ordering or a prefix of the location, though it cannot reference more fields than what are in the provided ORDER BY. Continuing off the example above, attaching the following start cursors will have varying impact: START BEFORE (2, /k/123): start the query right before a = 1 AND b > 2 AND __name__ > /k/123. START AFTER (10): start the query right after a = 1 AND b > 10. Unlike OFFSET which requires scanning over the first N results to skip, a start cursor allows the query to begin at a logical position. This position is not required to match an actual result, it will scan forward from this position to find the next document. Requires: The number of values cannot be greater than the number of fields specified in the ORDER BY clause. |
| end_at | Cursor A potential prefix of a position in the result set to end the query at. This is similar to START_AT but with it controlling the end position rather than the start position. Requires: The number of values cannot be greater than the number of fields specified in the ORDER BY clause. |
| offset | int32 The number of documents to skip before returning the first result. This applies after the constraints specified by the WHERE, START AT, & END AT but before the LIMIT clause. Requires: The value must be greater than or equal to zero if specified. |
| limit | Int32Value The maximum number of results to return. Applies after all other constraints. Requires: The value must be greater than or equal to zero if specified. |
| find_nearest | FindNearest Optional. A potential nearest neighbors search. Applies after all other filters and ordering. Finds the closest vector embeddings to the given query vector. |

The behavior of the specified distance_measure will affect the meaning of the distance threshold. Since DOT_PRODUCT distances increase when the vectors are more similar, the comparison is inverted. For EUCLIDEAN, COSINE: WHERE distance <= distance_threshold For DOT_PRODUCT: WHERE distance >= distance_threshold |

DistanceMeasure

The distance measure to use when comparing vectors.

| Enums |
| --- |
| DISTANCE_MEASURE_UNSPECIFIED | Should not be set. |
| EUCLIDEAN | Measures the EUCLIDEAN distance between the vectors. See Euclidean to learn more. The resulting distance decreases the more similar two vectors are. |
| COSINE | COSINE distance compares vectors based on the angle between them, which allows you to measure similarity that isn't based on the vectors magnitude. We recommend using DOT_PRODUCT with unit normalized vectors instead of COSINE distance, which is mathematically equivalent with better performance. See Cosine Similarity to learn more about COSINE similarity and COSINE distance. The resulting COSINE distance decreases the more similar two vectors are. |

| --- |
| target_id | int32 The target ID that identifies the target on the stream. Must be a positive number and non-zero. If target_id is 0 (or unspecified), the server will assign an ID for this target and return that in a TargetChange::ADD event. Once a target with target_id=0 is added, all subsequent targets must also have target_id=0. If an AddTarget request with target_id != 0 is sent to the server after a target with target_id=0 is added, the server will immediately send a response with a TargetChange::Remove event. Note that if the client sends multiple AddTarget requests without an ID, the order of IDs returned in TargetChange.target_ids are undefined. Therefore, clients should provide a target ID instead of relying on the server to assign one. If target_id is non-zero, there must not be an existing active target on this stream with the same ID. |
| once | bool If the target should be removed once it is current and consistent. |
| expected_count | Int32Value The number of documents that last matched the query at the resume token or read time. This value is only relevant when a resume_type is provided.
