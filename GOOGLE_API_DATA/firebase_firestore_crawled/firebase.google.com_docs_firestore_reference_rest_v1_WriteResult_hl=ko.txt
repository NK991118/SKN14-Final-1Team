| Fields |
| --- |
| updateTime | string (Timestamp format) The last update time of the document after applying the write. Not set after a delete. If the write did not actually change the document, this will be the previous updateTime. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z", "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30". |
| transformResults[] | object (Value) The results of applying each DocumentTransform.FieldTransform, in the same order. |
