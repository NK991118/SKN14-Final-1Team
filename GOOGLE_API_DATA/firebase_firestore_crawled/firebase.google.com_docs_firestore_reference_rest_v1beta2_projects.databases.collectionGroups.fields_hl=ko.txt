Resource: Field

Represents a single field in the database.Fields are grouped by their "Collection Group", which represent all collections in the database with the same id.

| JSON representation |
| --- |
| {   "name": string,   "indexConfig": {     object (IndexConfig)   } } |

| Fields |
| --- |
| name | string A field name of the form projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/collectionGroups/{collectionId}/fields/{fieldPath} A field path may be a simple field name, e.g. address or a path to fields within mapValue , e.g. address.city, or a special field path. The only valid special field is *, which represents any field. Field paths may be quoted using (backtick). The only character that needs to be escaped within a quoted field path is the backtick character itself, escaped using a backslash. Special characters in field paths that must be quoted include:*,., ``` (backtick),[,]`, as well as any ascii symbolic characters. Examples: (Note: Comments here are written in markdown syntax, so there is an additional layer of backticks to represent a code block) \address.city`represents a field namedaddress.city, not the map key cityin the fieldaddress. `*`represents a field named*`, not any field. A special Field contains the default indexing settings for all fields. This field's resource name is: projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/collectionGroups/__default__/fields/* Indexes defined on this Field will be applied to all fields which do not have their own Field index configuration. |
| indexConfig | object (IndexConfig) The index configuration for this field. If unset, field indexing will revert to the configuration defined by the ancestorField. To explicitly remove all indexes for this field, specify an index config with an empty list of indexes. |

IndexConfig

The index configuration for this field.

| JSON representation |
| --- |
| {   "indexes": [     {       object (Index)     }   ],   "usesAncestorConfig": boolean,   "ancestorField": string,   "reverting": boolean } |

| Fields |
| --- |
| indexes[] | object (Index) The indexes supported for this field. |
| usesAncestorConfig | boolean Output only. When true, the Field's index configuration is set from the configuration specified by the ancestorField. When false, the Field's index configuration is defined explicitly. |
| ancestorField | string Output only. Specifies the resource name of the Field from which this field's index configuration is set (when usesAncestorConfig is true), or from which it would be set if this field had no index configuration (when usesAncestorConfig is false). |
| reverting | boolean Output only When true, the Field's index configuration is in the process of being reverted. Once complete, the index config will transition to the same state as the field specified by ancestorField, at which point usesAncestorConfig will be true and reverting will be false. |

| Methods |
| --- |
| get | Gets the metadata and configuration for a Field. |
| list | Lists the field configuration and metadata for this database. |
| patch | Updates a field configuration. |
