onSpeedingUpdated
(float percentageAboveLimit, SpeedAlertSeverity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity] speedAlertSeverity)

Notifies you that the driver is speeding above the speed limit by the specified percentage, and
the SpeedAlertSeverity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity] being SpeedAlertSeverity.MINOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MINOR] or SpeedAlertSeverity.MAJOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MAJOR] if speeding, or SpeedAlertSeverity.NONE [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#NONE] if not speeding.

When the speed limit is unknown or the speed is unknown, NavSDK reports the percentage as
-1 and SpeedAlertSeverity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity] as SpeedAlertSeverity.NONE [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#NONE].
When the driver is not speeding according to the thresholds configured in SpeedAlertOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertOptions], NavSDK reports the percentage as 0, and the SpeedAlertSeverity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity] as SpeedAlertSeverity.NONE [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#NONE].
When the driver is speeding according to the thresholds configured in SpeedAlertOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertOptions], NavSDK reports the percentage over the speed limit, and the SpeedAlertSeverity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity] as SpeedAlertSeverity.MINOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MINOR] or SpeedAlertSeverity.MAJOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MAJOR] according to the configured thresholds.
