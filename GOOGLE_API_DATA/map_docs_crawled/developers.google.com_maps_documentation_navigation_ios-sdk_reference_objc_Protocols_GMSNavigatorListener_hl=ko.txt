GMSNavigatorListener

@protocol GMSNavigatorListener <NSObject>

Listener for events on GMSNavigator [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigator.html].

-navigator:didArriveAtWaypoint: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSNavigatorListener#/c:objc(pl)GMSNavigatorListener(im)navigator:didArriveAtWaypoint:]

Called when the driver has arrived at a GMSNavigationWaypoint [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint.html].

Note
This method is called even if stopGuidanceAtArrival is set to NO.

Note
When navigating a route with multiple waypoints, this method is called once for each
waypoint.

Declaration

Swift
optional func navigator(_ navigator: GMSNavigator [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigator.html], didArriveAt waypoint: GMSNavigationWaypoint [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint.html])

-navigatorDidChangeRoute: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSNavigatorListener#/c:objc(pl)GMSNavigatorListener(im)navigatorDidChangeRoute:]

Called when the current route changes or is cleared.

Note that there are several types of triggers for this listener, including
but not limited to:

the in-progress trip was updated
the driver diverged from the current route
the driver selected an alternative route from the UI
the driver was offered or required to use a better route
the driver started navigating to a destination (via a call to setDestinations)
the driver started navigating to a new waypoint after arriving at a
previous one
the route was cleared (via a call to clearDestinations)

Notifies you that the device has detected that the vehicle is exceeding the speed limit by the
specified percentage along with the current speed alert severity. This is called at regular
intervals whenever a valid speed or speed limit update is available. This usually results in
frequent calls during active navigation when the driver is moving.

Tells the listener that a prompt will be presented during guided navigation.

A prompt is a modal UI element that covers some part of the screen and prevents other UI elements
from being interacted with until it is dismissed (whether automatically, programmatically, or by
user action).
