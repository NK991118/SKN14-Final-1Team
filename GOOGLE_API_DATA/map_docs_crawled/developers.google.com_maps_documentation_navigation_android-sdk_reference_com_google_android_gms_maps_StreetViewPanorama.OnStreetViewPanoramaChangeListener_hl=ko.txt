(StreetViewPanoramaLocation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/StreetViewPanoramaLocation] location)

The StreetViewPanorama performs an animated transition from one location to another when the
user performs a manual navigation action. This callback is called when the transition
animation has occurred and the rendering of the first panorama has occurred. This callback
also occurs when the developer sets a position and the rendering of the first panorama has
occurred. It is possible that not all the panoramas have loaded when this callback is
activated. Implementations of this method are always invoked on the main thread.

Parameters
| location | Location the StreetViewPanorama is changed to. null if it is an invalid panorama |
