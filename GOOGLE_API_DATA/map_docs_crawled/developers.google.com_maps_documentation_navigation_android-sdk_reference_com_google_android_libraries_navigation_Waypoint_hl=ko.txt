Returns the lat/lng position of the waypoint if it has been set, otherwise it returns null.

public
boolean

getPreferSameSideOfRoad
()

Returns whether it is preferred to route the driver to the same side of the road.

Returns
a boolean indicating whether the same side of the road is preferred.

public
int

getPreferredHeading
()

Returns an angle used to express the direction of traffic on the side of the road that the
