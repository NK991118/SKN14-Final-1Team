public     class
NavigationView
extends RelativeLayout

A View which displays a map for navigation.
Users of this class must forward all the life cycle methods from the Activity [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html] or Fragment [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html] containing this view to the corresponding
ones in this class. In particular, you must forward on the following methods:

onCreate(Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)]
onStart() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onStart()]
onResume() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onResume()]
onPause() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onPause()]
onStop() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onStop()]
onDestroy() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onDestroy()]
onConfigurationChanged(Configuration) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onConfigurationChanged(android.content.res.Configuration)]
onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle)]
onTrimMemory(int) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onTrimMemory(int)]

If the NavView is added after its parent Activity [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html] or Fragment [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html] has been through its creation lifecycle, you must call onCreate(Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)],
onStart() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onStart()] and onResume() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onResume()] manually to properly initialize it. Similarly, if a
NavView is detached from its parent Activity [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html] or Fragment [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html],
you must manually call onPause() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onPause()], onStop() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onStop()] and onDestroy() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#onDestroy()] to prevent leaks.
Note: You are advised not to add children to this view.
All calls to NavView should be performed on the UI thread.

| --- | --- |

public
void

setNavigationUiEnabled
(boolean enableNavigationUi)

Enables or disables navigation UI.
When navigation UI is enabled, the view is in a navigation-ready state to focus on providing
navigation experience. Navigation oriented features will be available under this mode. For
example: the camera follows the user’s location, night mode support, navigation focused tile
style, speedometer, etc. In contrast, features that are maps focused and conflict with
navigation will be unavailable. For example: indoor, zoom control buttons(use gestures
instead), my location button.
When navigation UI is disabled, the view will be in a maps focused state where these
navigation focused features will be unavailable and those maps focused features would be
available. However, if there is an ongoing guided navigation session, it will continue in the
background. Guided navigation must be stopped by calling Navigator.stopGuidance() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator#stopGuidance()].
Navigation UI will also be enabled when GoogleMap.followMyLocation(int) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#followMyLocation(int)] is called.
This call might be asynchronous. For example, when tries to enable navigation UI but no
Navigator [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator] has not been created. In this case, navigation UI will be enabled only after
an instance of Navigator [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator] is created. Uses addOnNavigationUiChangedListener(OnNavigationUiChangedListener) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#addOnNavigationUiChangedListener(com.google.android.libraries.navigation.OnNavigationUiChangedListener)] to listen to navigation UI
change result.

Parameters
| enableNavigationUi | whether to enable navigation UI. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setRecenterButtonEnabled
(boolean enabled)

thread.

Parameters
| enabled |  |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setReportIncidentButtonEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Sets whether the report incident button should be shown. This method should only be called on
the UI thread.

Parameters
| enabled |  |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setSpeedLimitIconEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Specifies whether the speed limit icon is shown. Only call this method on the UI thread. By
default, the speed limit icon is not shown.
When enabled, a speed limit icon that indicates the speed limit of the road appears in the
bottom start corner during guidance. The icon only appears in locations where reliable speed
limit data is available. When speedometer icon is visible, they are attached.
If the recenter button is enabled, the speed limit icon is temporarily hidden when the
recenter button is shown.
Note: Drivers must follow all posted signs on the road, and use the speed limit icon only as
a reference. The accuracy of speed limit data cannot be guaranteed. You may report inaccuracies
in our speed limit data by filing a case in the Google Cloud Support
Portal [https://developers.google.com/maps/premium/support#support_portal].

Parameters
| enabled |  |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setSpeedometerEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Specifies whether the speedometer is shown. Only call this method on the UI thread. By default,
the speedometer is not shown.
When enabled, a speedometer that indicates the vehicle speed appears in the bottom start
corner during guidance. When speed limit icon is visible, they are attached, and then
speedometer can have different colors for text and background, depending on the speeding
severity.
Enabling speedometer also enables the speed limit icon altogether, however you can use
setSpeedLimitIconEnabled(boolean) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#setSpeedLimitIconEnabled(boolean)] to disable/enable speed the limit icon separately.
When the recenter button is enabled, the speedometer is temporarily hidden when the recenter
button displays.

Only call this method on the UI thread.
By setting a null SpeedometerUiOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedometerUiOptions], you are clearing the previous one if
set. When no SpeedometerUiOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedometerUiOptions] is configured, speedometer UI fallbacks to NavSDK
default configurations for speed alerts of different SpeedAlertSeverity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity]:

SpeedAlertSeverity.MINOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MINOR] speed alert in day mode: red text in white background
