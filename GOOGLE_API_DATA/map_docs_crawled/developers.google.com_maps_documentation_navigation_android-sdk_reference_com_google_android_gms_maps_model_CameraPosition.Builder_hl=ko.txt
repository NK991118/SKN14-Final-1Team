bearing
(float bearing)

Sets the direction that the camera is pointing in, in degrees clockwise from north.

Parameters
| bearing |  |

build
()

Builds a CameraPosition [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/CameraPosition].

target
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] location)

Sets the location that the camera is pointing at.

Parameters
| location |  |

tilt
(float tilt)

Sets the angle, in degrees, of the camera from the nadir (directly facing the Earth). When
changing the camera position for a map, this value is restricted depending on the zoom level
of the camera. The restrictions are as follows:

For zoom levels less than 10 the maximum is 30.
For zoom levels from 10 to 14 the maximum increases linearly from 30 to 45 (e.g. at
zoom level 12, the maximum is 37.5).
For zoom levels from 14 to 15.5 the maximum increases linearly from 45 to 67.5.
For zoom levels greater than 15.5 the maximum is 67.5.

The minimum is always 0 (directly down). If you specify a value outside this range and try to
move the camera to this camera position it will be clamped to these bounds.

Parameters
| tilt |  |

zoom
(float zoom)

Sets the zoom level of the camera. Zoom level is defined such that at zoom level 0, the whole
world is approximately 256dp wide (assuming that the camera is not tilted). Increasing the
zoom level by 1 doubles the width of the world on the screen. Hence at zoom level N, the
width of the world is approximately 256 * 2 N dp, i.e., at zoom level 2, the whole
world is approximately 1024dp wide.
When changing the camera position for a map, the zoom level of the camera is restricted to
a certain range depending on various factors including location, map type and map size. Use
GoogleMap.getMinZoomLevel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#getMinZoomLevel()] and
GoogleMap.getMaxZoomLevel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#getMaxZoomLevel()] to
find the restrictions. Note that the camera zoom need not be an integer value.

Parameters
