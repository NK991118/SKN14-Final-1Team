avoidHighways
(boolean avoidHighways)

Configures whether to avoid highways and motorways when generating a route to a destination. If
the value is not specified, the default value is false.

Parameters

avoidTolls
(boolean avoidTolls)

Configures whether to avoid toll roads when generating a route to a destination. If the value
is not specified, the default value is false.

Parameters
| avoidTolls | If true, toll roads are avoided. |
| --- | --- |

Returns
the object for which the method was called with the updated toll avoidance setting

public
AlternateRoutesStrategy [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/AlternateRoutesStrategy]

getAlternateRoutesStrategy
()

Returns the preferred display strategy for the number of alternate routes that are shown during
navigation.

public
boolean

getAvoidFerries
()

Returns a boolean indicating whether ferries are avoided.

Returns
true if ferries are avoided

public
boolean

getAvoidHighways
()

Returns a boolean indicating whether highways and motorways are avoided.

Returns
true if highways and motorways are avoided

public
boolean

getAvoidTolls
()

Returns a boolean indicating whether toll roads are avoided.

Returns
true if toll roads are avoided

public
long

getLocationTimeoutMs
()

Returns the maximum time in milliseconds to wait for a location fix before Navigator.setDestinations(List) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator#setDestinations(java.util.List%3Ccom.google.android.libraries.navigation.Waypoint%3E)] fails. If the value is zero, there is no limit.

Returns
the maximum time to wait for a location fix

public
int

getRoutingStrategy
()

public
List<Integer>

getTargetDistancesMeters
()

public
int

getTravelMode
()

Returns the type of directions to provide to the user.

public
RoutingOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions]

locationTimeoutMs
(long locationTimeoutMs)

Configures the maximum time to wait for a location fix before Navigator.setDestinations(List) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator#setDestinations(java.util.List%3Ccom.google.android.libraries.navigation.Waypoint%3E)]
fails with Navigator.RouteStatus.LOCATION_UNKNOWN [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator.RouteStatus#LOCATION_UNKNOWN]. A value of zero, the default, will
cause it to wait forever.

Parameters
| locationTimeoutMs | The maximum time, in milliseconds, to wait for a location. |
| --- | --- |

Returns
the object for which the method was called, with the updated location timeout setting

public
RoutingOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions]

routingStrategy
(int routingStrategy)

Specifies the routing strategy used in navigation.
If you set a targetDistancesMeters, and if you set a routing strategy other than RoutingOptions.RoutingStrategy.TARGET_DISTANCE [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions.RoutingStrategy#TARGET_DISTANCE], then the targetDistance field is cleared. If RoutingOptions.RoutingStrategy.TARGET_DISTANCE [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions.RoutingStrategy#TARGET_DISTANCE] is the desired strategy, then you must set a valid targetDistancesMeters(List) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions#targetDistancesMeters(java.util.List%3Cjava.lang.Integer%3E)] by calling targetDistancesMeters(List) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions#targetDistancesMeters(java.util.List%3Cjava.lang.Integer%3E)] separately.

Parameters
| routingStrategy |  |
| --- | --- |

public
RoutingOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions]

targetDistancesMeters
(List<Integer> targetDistancesMeters)

Specifies the target distance (in meters) to each destination, and overrides the routing
strategy with RoutingOptions.RoutingStrategy.TARGET_DISTANCE [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions.RoutingStrategy#TARGET_DISTANCE].
Warning: This is an experimental routing strategy. It is only available for single
destination trips. If you set multiple destinations and/or target distances, then RoutingOptions.RoutingStrategy.TARGET_DISTANCE [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions.RoutingStrategy#TARGET_DISTANCE] is applied to the first destination using the target distance
at index 0 of targetDistancesMeters(List) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions#targetDistancesMeters(java.util.List%3Cjava.lang.Integer%3E)] and RoutingOptions.RoutingStrategy.DEFAULT_BEST [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions.RoutingStrategy#DEFAULT_BEST] is
applied to the remaining destinations.
Warning: You must not use RoutingOptions.RoutingStrategy.TARGET_DISTANCE [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions.RoutingStrategy#TARGET_DISTANCE] in combination with any
AlternateRoutesStrategy [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/AlternateRoutesStrategy] except the default AlternateRoutesStrategy.SHOW_ALL [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/AlternateRoutesStrategy#SHOW_ALL]. If
you use it in combination with other AlternateRoutesStrategy [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/AlternateRoutesStrategy]s, then suboptimal routes
are calculated.

Parameters
| targetDistancesMeters | The non-empty list of positive integers representing one desired target distance (in meters) for each destination set using Navigator.setDestinations(List). |
| --- | --- |

Returns
the object upon which the method was called, with the updated target distances and
routing strategy.

public
RoutingOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions]

travelMode
(int travelMode)

Specifies the type of transportation used to determine the navigation directions.

Parameters
| travelMode |  |
| --- | --- |

Returns
the object for which the method was called with the updated travel mode.
