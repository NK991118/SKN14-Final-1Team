Pure Service Area Business attribute
The Pure Service Area Business attribute indicates whether a place is a pure service area business, and includes these businesses in search by text and autocomplete results.
A pure service area business is a business that visits or delivers to customers directly, but does not serve customers at their business address. For example, businesses like cleaning services or plumbers. Those businesses may not have a physical address or location on Google Maps.
