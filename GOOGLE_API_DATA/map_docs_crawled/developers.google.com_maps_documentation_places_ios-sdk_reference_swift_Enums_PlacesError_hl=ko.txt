PlacesError

enum PlacesError
extension PlacesError : Equatable, Error, Hashable, Sendable

Places error types.

==(_:_:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO2eeoiySbAC_ACtFZ]

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.

Equality is the inverse of inequality. For any values a and b,
a == b implies that a != b is false.

Declaration

Swift
static func == (a: PlacesError, b: PlacesError) -> Bool

accessNotConfigured(_:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO19accessNotConfiguredyACSScACmF]

The Places API service for iOS is not enabled.

See the developer’s guide [https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/start]
to learn how to set up the Places SDK for iOS or the
migration guide [https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/client-migration]
if you are migrating from an earlier version.

Declaration

Swift
case accessNotConfigured(String)

deviceRateLimitExceeded(_:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO23deviceRateLimitExceededyACSScACmF]

Operation failed due to exceeding the per-device usage rate limit.

This status code shouldn’t be returned during normal usage of the API. It relates to usage of
the API that far exceeds normal request levels. See the usage limits guide [https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/usage] for more
information.

Declaration

Swift
case deviceRateLimitExceeded(String)

hash(into:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO4hash4intoys6HasherVz_tF]

Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the
given hasher.

Implement this method to conform to the Hashable protocol. The
components used for hashing must be the same as the components compared
in your type’s == operator implementation. Call hasher.combine(_:)
with each of these components.

Important
In your implementation of hash(into:),
don’t call finalize() on the hasher instance provided,
or replace it with a different instance.
Doing so may become a compile-time error in the future.

Declaration

Swift
func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher)

hashValue [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO9hashValueSivp]

The hash value.

Hash values are not guaranteed to be equal across different executions of
your program. Do not save hash values to use during a future execution.

Important
hashValue is deprecated as a Hashable requirement. To
conform to Hashable, implement the hash(into:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError.html#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO4hash4intoys6HasherVz_tF] requirement instead.
The compiler provides an implementation for hashValue for you.

Declaration

Swift
The application’s bundle identifier does not match one of the allowed iOS applications for the
API key.

See the developer’s guide [https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/start]
for how to configure bundle restrictions on API keys.

Declaration

Swift
case incorrectBundleIdentifier(String)

internal(_:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO8internalyACSScACmF]

An internal error occurred in the Places SDK library.

If you believe this error represents a bug, please file a report using the instructions on our
community and support page [https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/support].

Declaration

Swift
case `internal`(String)

invalidRequest(_:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO14invalidRequestyACSScACmF]

The Places SDK could not process the invalid request.

If you believe this error represents a bug, please file a report using the instructions on our
community and support page [https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/support].

Declaration

Swift
case invalidRequest(String)

keyExpired(_:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO10keyExpiredyACSScACmF]

Operation failed due to an expired API key.

See the developer’s guide [https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/start]
for information on creating and using an API key.

Declaration

Swift
case keyExpired(String)

keyInvalid(_:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO10keyInvalidyACSScACmF]

Operation failed due to an invalid (malformed or missing) API key.

See the developer’s guide [https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/start]
for information on creating and using an API key.

Declaration

Swift
case keyInvalid(String)

localizedDescription [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO20localizedDescriptionSSvp]

Retrieve the localized description for this error.

Declaration

Swift
The Places SDK could not find the user’s location. This may be because the user has not
allowed the application to access location information.

Declaration

Swift
case location(String)

network(_:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO7networkyACSScACmF]

Something went wrong with the connection to the Places API server.

Declaration

Swift
case network(String)

rateLimitExceeded(_:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO17rateLimitExceededyACSScACmF]

Operation failed due to exceeding the usage rate limit for the API key.

This status code shouldn’t be returned during normal usage of the API. It relates to usage of
the API that far exceeds normal request levels. See the usage limits guide [https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/usage] for more
information.

Declaration

Swift
case rateLimitExceeded(String)

server(_:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/PlacesError#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift0B5ErrorO6serveryACSScACmF]

The Places API server returned a response that we couldn’t understand.

If you believe this error represents a bug, please file a report using the instructions on our
community and support page [https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/support].

Declaration

Swift
case server(String)

Operation failed due to exceeding the quota usage limit.

See the usage limits guide [https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/usage]
for information on usage limits and how to request a higher limit.

Declaration
