public  final   class
Polygon
extends Object

A polygon on the earth's surface. A polygon can be convex or concave, it may span the 180
meridian and it can have holes that are not filled in. It has the following properties:

Outline
The outline is specified by a list of vertices in clockwise or counterclockwise order. It
is not necessary for the start and end points to coincide; if they do not, the polygon will
be automatically closed. Line segments are drawn between consecutive points in the shorter
of the two directions (east or west).
Holes
A hole is a region inside the polygon that is not filled. A hole is specified in exactly
the same way as the outline. A hole must be fully contained within the outline. Multiple
holes can be specified, however overlapping holes are not supported.
Stroke Width
Line segment width in screen pixels. The width is constant and independent of the camera's
zoom level. The default value is 10.
Stroke Color
Line segment color in ARGB format, the same format used by Color [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Color.html].
The default value is black (0xff000000).
Stroke Joint Type
The joint type defines the shape to be used when joining adjacent line segments at all
vertices of the polygon's outline. See JointType [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/JointType] for supported joint types. The
default value is JointType.DEFAULT [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/JointType#DEFAULT].
Stroke pattern
Solid (default, represented by null) or a sequence of PatternItem [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/PatternItem] objects
to be repeated along the polygon's outline. Available PatternItem types: Gap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Gap] (defined by gap length in pixels), Dash [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Dash] (defined by stroke width and dash
length in pixels) and Dot [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Dot] (circular, centered on the polygon's outline, diameter
defined by stroke width in pixels).
Fill Color
Fill color in ARGB format, the same format used by Color [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Color.html]. The
default value is transparent (0x00000000). If the polygon geometry is not specified
correctly (see above for Outline and Holes), then no fill will be drawn.
Z-Index
The order in which this polygon is drawn with respect to other overlays, including Polyline [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Polyline]s, Circle [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Circle]s, GroundOverlay [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/GroundOverlay]s and TileOverlay [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/TileOverlay]s, but not
Marker [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker]s. An overlay with a larger z-index is drawn over overlays with smaller
z-indices. The order of overlays with the same z-index value is arbitrary. The default is
0.
Visibility
Indicates if the polygon is visible or invisible, i.e., whether it is drawn on the map. An
invisible polygon is not drawn, but retains all of its other properties. The default is
true, i.e., visible.
Geodesic status
Indicates whether the segments of the polygon should be drawn as geodesics, as opposed to
straight lines on the Mercator projection. A geodesic is the shortest path between two
points on the Earth's surface. The geodesic curve is constructed assuming the Earth is a
sphere
Clickability
If you want to handle events fired when the user clicks the polygon, set this property to
true. You can change this value at any time. The default is false. If this
property is set to true, your app will receive notifications to the GoogleMap.OnPolygonClickListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap.OnPolygonClickListener] registered through GoogleMap.setOnPolygonClickListener(GoogleMap.OnPolygonClickListener) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#setOnPolygonClickListener(com.google.android.gms.maps.GoogleMap.OnPolygonClickListener)].
Tag
An Object associated with the polygon. For example, the Object can contain
data about what the polygon represents. This is easier than storing a separate Map<Polygon, Object>. As another example, you can associate a String ID
corresponding to the ID from a data set. Google Maps SDK for Android neither reads nor
writes this property.

Methods in this class must be called on the Android UI thread. If not, an IllegalStateException [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/reference/java/lang/IllegalStateException.html] will be thrown at runtime.
Example
GoogleMap map;
Polygon polygon = map.addPolygon(new PolygonOptions()
.add(new LatLng(0, 0), new LatLng(0, 5), new LatLng(3, 5), new LatLng(0, 0))
.strokeColor(Color.RED)
.fillColor(Color.BLUE));

getHoles
()

Returns a snapshot of the holes of this polygon at this time . The list returned is a copy of

setClickable
(boolean clickable)

Sets the clickability of the polygon. If the polygon is clickable, your app will receive
notifications to the GoogleMap.OnPolygonClickListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap.OnPolygonClickListener] when the user clicks the polygon.

| --- | --- |

public
void

setStrokeColor
(int color)

Sets the stroke color of this polygon.

Parameters
| color | the color in ARGB format |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setStrokeJointType
(int jointType)

Sets the joint type for all vertices of the polygon's outline.
See JointType [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/JointType] for allowed values. The default value JointType.DEFAULT [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/JointType#DEFAULT] will
be used if joint type is undefined or is not one of the allowed values.

Parameters
| jointType | the stroke joint type. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setStrokePattern
(List<PatternItem [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/PatternItem]> pattern)

Sets the stroke pattern of the polygon's outline. The default stroke pattern is solid,
represented by null.

Parameters

Sets the stroke width of this polygon.

Parameters
| width | the width in display pixels. |

public
void

setTag
(Object tag)

Sets the tag for the polygon.
You can use this property to associate an arbitrary Object with this polygon. For
example, the Object can contain data about what the polygon represents. This is easier
than storing a separate Map<Polygon, Object>. As another example, you can associate a
String ID corresponding to the ID from a data set. Google Maps SDK for Android neither
reads nor writes this property. It is your responsibility to call setTag(null) to clear
the tag when you no longer need it, to prevent memory leaks in your app.

Parameters
| tag | if null, the tag is cleared. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setVisible
(boolean visible)

Sets the visibility of this polygon. When not visible, a polygon is not drawn, but it keeps all
its other properties.

Parameters
| visible | if true, then the polygon is visible; if false, it is not. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setZIndex
(float zIndex)

Sets the zIndex of this polygon. Polygons with higher zIndices are drawn above those with lower
indices.

Parameters
| zIndex | the zIndex of this polygon. |
