GMSMapLayer

@interface GMSMapLayer : GMSCALayer [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSCALayer.html]

GMSMapLayer is a custom subclass of CALayer, provided as the layer class on GMSMapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMapView.html].
This layer should not be instantiated directly. It provides model access to the camera normally
defined on GMSMapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMapView.html].

Modifying or animating these properties will typically interrupt any current gesture on
GMSMapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMapView.html], e.g., a user’s pan or rotation. Similarly, if a user performs an enabled gesture
during an animation, the animation will stop ‘in-place’ (at the current presentation value).
