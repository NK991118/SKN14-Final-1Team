public     class
SpeedAlertOptions
extends Object
implements
Parcelable

Encapsulates triggering thresholds for different severity levels of speed alerts, represented by
SpeedAlertSeverity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity].
You can use this class to customize the speed alert triggering thresholds as a percentage for
both SpeedAlertSeverity.MINOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MINOR] and SpeedAlertSeverity.MAJOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MAJOR] alerts, and to
customize the time-based triggering threshold for SpeedAlertSeverity.MAJOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MAJOR] speed alert.
The speed alerts that are triggered by thresholds from this SpeedAlertOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertOptions] have
their UI customized in SpeedometerUiOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedometerUiOptions].
