GMSCameraPosition

@interface GMSCameraPosition : NSObject <NSCopying, NSMutableCopying>

An immutable class that aggregates all camera position parameters.

target [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSCameraPosition#/c:objc(cs)GMSCameraPosition(py)target]

Location on the Earth towards which the camera points.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly) CLLocationCoordinate2D target;

zoom [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSCameraPosition#/c:objc(cs)GMSCameraPosition(py)zoom]

Zoom level. Zoom uses an exponentional scale, where zoom 0 represents the entire world as a
256 x 256 square. Each successive zoom level increases magnification by a factor of 2. So at
zoom level 1, the world is 512x512, and at zoom level 2, the entire world is 1024x1024.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly) float zoom;

bearing [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSCameraPosition#/c:objc(cs)GMSCameraPosition(py)bearing]

Bearing of the camera, in degrees clockwise from true north.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly) CLLocationDirection bearing;

viewingAngle [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSCameraPosition#/c:objc(cs)GMSCameraPosition(py)viewingAngle]

The angle, in degrees, of the camera from the nadir (directly facing the Earth). 0 is
straight down, 90 is parallel to the ground. Note that the maximum angle allowed is dependent
on the zoom. You can think of it as a series of line segments as a function of zoom, rather
than a step function. For zoom 16 and above, the maximum angle is 65 degrees. For zoom 10 and
below, the maximum angle is 30 degrees.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly) double viewingAngle;

-initWithTarget:zoom:bearing:viewingAngle: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSCameraPosition#/c:objc(cs)GMSCameraPosition(im)initWithTarget:zoom:bearing:viewingAngle:]

Designated initializer. Configures this GMSCameraPosition with all available camera properties.
Building a GMSCameraPosition via this initializer (or by the following convenience
constructors) will implicitly clamp camera values.

Declaration

Swift
init(target: CLLocationCoordinate2D, zoom: Float, bearing: CLLocationDirection, viewingAngle: Double)

Objective-C
- (nonnull instancetype)initWithTarget:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)target
zoom:(float)zoom
bearing:(CLLocationDirection)bearing
| target | Location on the earth towards which the camera points. |
| --- | --- |
| zoom | The zoom level near the center of the screen. |
| bearing | Bearing of the camera in degrees clockwise from true north. |
| viewingAngle | The angle, in degrees, of the camera angle from the nadir (directly facing the Earth) |

-initWithTarget:zoom: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSCameraPosition#/c:objc(cs)GMSCameraPosition(im)initWithTarget:zoom:]

Convenience initializer for GMSCameraPosition for a particular target and zoom level. This will
set the bearing and viewingAngle properties of this camera to zero defaults (i.e., directly
facing the Earth’s surface, with the top of the screen pointing north).

Declaration

Swift
init(target: CLLocationCoordinate2D, zoom: Float)

Objective-C
- (nonnull instancetype)initWithTarget:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)target
| target | Location on the earth towards which the camera points. |
| --- | --- |
| zoom | The zoom level near the center of the screen. |

-initWithLatitude:longitude:zoom: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSCameraPosition#/c:objc(cs)GMSCameraPosition(im)initWithLatitude:longitude:zoom:]

Convenience initializer for GMSCameraPosition for a particular latitidue, longitude and zoom
level. This will set the bearing and viewingAngle properties of this camera to zero defaults
(i.e., directly facing the Earth’s surface, with the top of the screen pointing north).

Declaration

Swift
init(latitude: CLLocationDegrees, longitude: CLLocationDegrees, zoom: Float)

Objective-C
- (nonnull instancetype)initWithLatitude:(CLLocationDegrees)latitude
longitude:(CLLocationDegrees)longitude
| latitude | The latitude component of the location towards which the camera points. |
| --- | --- |
| longitude | The latitude component of the location towards which the camera points. |
| zoom | The zoom level near the center of the screen. |

-initWithLatitude:longitude:zoom:bearing:viewingAngle: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSCameraPosition#/c:objc(cs)GMSCameraPosition(im)initWithLatitude:longitude:zoom:bearing:viewingAngle:]

Convenience initializer for GMSCameraPosition, with latitude/longitude and all other camera
properties as per -initWithTarget:zoom:bearing:viewingAngle:.

Declaration

Swift

| latitude | The latitude component of the location towards which the camera points. |
| --- | --- |
| longitude | The latitude component of the location towards which the camera points. |
| zoom | The zoom level near the center of the screen. |
| bearing | Bearing of the camera in degrees clockwise from true north. |
| viewingAngle | The angle, in degrees, of the camera angle from the nadir (directly facing the Earth) |

+cameraWithTarget:zoom: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSCameraPosition#/c:objc(cs)GMSCameraPosition(cm)cameraWithTarget:zoom:]

Convenience constructor for GMSCameraPosition for a particular target and zoom level. This will
set the bearing and viewingAngle properties of this camera to zero defaults (i.e., directly
facing the Earth’s surface, with the top of the screen pointing north).

Declaration

zoom:(float)zoom
bearing:(CLLocationDirection)bearing
Get the zoom level at which meters distance, at given coord on Earth, correspond to the
specified number of screen points.

For extremely large or small distances the returned zoom level may be smaller or larger than the
minimum or maximum zoom level allowed on the camera.

This helper method is useful for building camera positions that contain specific physical areas
on Earth.

Declaration

Swift
class func zoom(at coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D, forMeters meters: CLLocationDistance, perPoints points: CGFloat) -> Float

Objective-C
+ (float)zoomAtCoordinate:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)coordinate
