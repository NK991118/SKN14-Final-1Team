GMSPanoramaView

@interface GMSPanoramaView : UIView

A panorama is used to display Street View imagery. It should be constructed via
[[GMSPanoramaView alloc] initWithFrame:], and configured post-initialization.

All properties and methods should be accessed on the main thread, similar to all UIKit objects.
The GMSPanoramaViewDelegate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSPanoramaViewDelegate.html] methods will also be called back only on the main thread.

The backgroundColor of this view is shown while no panorama is visible, such as while it is
loading or if the panorama is later set to nil. The alpha color of backgroundColor is not
supported.

panorama [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaView#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaView(py)panorama]

The panorama to display; setting it will transition to a new panorama. This is animated, except
for the initial panorama.

Can be set to nil to clear the view.

Requests a panorama near coordinate.

Upon successful completion -panoramaView:didMoveToPanorama: and
-panoramaView:didMoveToPanorama:nearCoordinate: will be sent to GMSPanoramaViewDelegate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSPanoramaViewDelegate.html].

On error -panoramaView:error:onMoveNearCoordinate: will be sent.

Repeated calls to -moveNearCoordinate: result in the previous pending (incomplete) transitions
being cancelled – only the most recent of -moveNearCoordinate: and -moveToPanoramaId: will
proceed and generate events.

Declaration

Swift
func moveNearCoordinate(_ coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D)

Objective-C
- (void)moveNearCoordinate:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)coordinate;

-moveNearCoordinate:radius: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaView#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaView(im)moveNearCoordinate:radius:]

Similar to -moveNearCoordinate: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaView.html#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaView(im)moveNearCoordinate:] but allows specifying a search radius (meters) around
coordinate.

Declaration

GMSPanoramaViewDelegate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSPanoramaViewDelegate.html].

On error -panoramaView:error:onMoveToPanoramaID: will be sent.

Repeated calls to -moveToPanoramaID: result in the previous pending (incomplete) transitions
being cancelled – only the most recent of -moveNearCoordinate:- and-moveToPanoramaId:` will
proceed and generate events.

Only panoramaIDs obtained from the Google Maps SDK for iOS are supported.

Declaration

Swift
func move(toPanoramaID panoramaID: String)

Objective-C
- (void)moveToPanoramaID:(nonnull NSString *)panoramaID;

-pointForOrientation: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaView#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaView(im)pointForOrientation:]

For the current view, returns the screen point the orientation points through.  This value may
be outside the view for forward facing orientations which are far enough away from straight
ahead.

The result will contain NaNs for camera orientations which point away from the view, where the
implied screen point would have had a negative distance from the camera in the direction of
orientation.

Declaration

Swift
func point(for orientation: GMSOrientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSOrientation.html]) -> CGPoint

Objective-C

-orientationForPoint: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaView#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaView(im)orientationForPoint:]

Given a point for this view, returns the current camera orientation pointing through that screen
location.  At the center of this view, the returned GMSOrientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSOrientation.html] will be approximately equal
to that of the current GMSPanoramaCamera [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaCamera.html].

Declaration

func orientation(for point: CGPoint) -> GMSOrientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSOrientation.html]

Objective-C
- (GMSOrientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSOrientation.html])orientationForPoint:(CGPoint)point;

+panoramaWithFrame:nearCoordinate: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaView#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaView(cm)panoramaWithFrame:nearCoordinate:]

Convenience constructor for GMSPanoramaView, which searches for and displays a GMSPanorama [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanorama.html]
near coordinate. This performs a similar action to that of -moveNearCoordinate: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaView.html#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaView(im)moveNearCoordinate:], and will
call the same delegate methods.
