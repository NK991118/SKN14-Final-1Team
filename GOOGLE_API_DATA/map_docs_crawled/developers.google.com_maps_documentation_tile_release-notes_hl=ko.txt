The Map Tiles API is making changes to its API response. These changes will go into effect Jun 9, 2025:

3D Tiles will continue to be in the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard glTF format. Renderer implementations must continue to support the OGC glTF specification, and accept any specification-compliant tiles. Any assumption of the existence of structures outside of this format, or reliance on undocumented details, can result in your application breaking.
root.json will now contain the root tile itself, instead of a link to the root tileset. Moving forward, one HTTP request will be required to begin traversing the tree, instead of two.
The extras field ("extras":{"comment":"path = "}}]}) will be removed from responses.

You can preview the changes to the response using https://tile.googleapis.com/v1/3dtiles/datasets/CgIYAQ/root?key=<api_key> and compare to the current output of https://tile.googleapis.com/v1/3dtiles/root?key=<api_key>.
