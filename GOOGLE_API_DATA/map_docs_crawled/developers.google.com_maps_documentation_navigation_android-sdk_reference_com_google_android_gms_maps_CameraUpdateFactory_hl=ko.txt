public  final   class
CameraUpdateFactory
extends Object

A class containing methods for creating CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] objects that change a map's camera.
To modify the map's camera, call GoogleMap.animateCamera(CameraUpdate) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#animateCamera(com.google.android.gms.maps.CameraUpdate)], GoogleMap.animateCamera(CameraUpdate, GoogleMap.CancelableCallback) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#animateCamera(com.google.android.gms.maps.CameraUpdate,%20com.google.android.gms.maps.GoogleMap.CancelableCallback)] or GoogleMap.moveCamera(CameraUpdate) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#moveCamera(com.google.android.gms.maps.CameraUpdate)], using a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] object created with this class.
For example, to zoom in on a map, you can use the following code:
GoogleMap map = ...;
map.animateCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.zoomIn());

Prior to using any methods from this class, you must do one of the following to ensure that
this class is initialized:

Wait for a GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap] to become available from a MapFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapFragment] or MapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView] that you have added to your application. You can obtain the GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap]
instance by calling getMapAsync() and waiting for the onMapReady(GoogleMap
map) callback.
Call MapsInitializer.initialize(Context) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapsInitializer#initialize(android.content.Context)]. As long as a GooglePlayServicesNotAvailableException [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/GooglePlayServicesNotAvailableException] isn't thrown, this class will be correctly
initialized.

CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate]

newCameraPosition
(CameraPosition [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/CameraPosition] cameraPosition)

Returns a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] that moves the camera to a specified CameraPosition [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/CameraPosition]. In
effect, this creates a transformation from the CameraPosition [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/CameraPosition] object's latitude,
longitude, zoom level, bearing and tilt.

Parameters
| cameraPosition |  |
| --- | --- |

Returns
a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] containing the transformation.

newLatLng
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] latLng)

Returns a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] that moves the center of the screen to a latitude and longitude
specified by a LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] object. This centers the camera on the LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] object.

Parameters
| latLng | a LatLng object containing the desired latitude and longitude. |
| --- | --- |

Returns
a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] containing the transformation.

newLatLngBounds
(LatLngBounds [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLngBounds] bounds, int padding)

Returns a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] that transforms the camera such that the specified
latitude/longitude bounds are centered on screen at the greatest possible zoom level. You can
specify padding, in order to inset the bounding box from the map view's edges. The returned
CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] has a bearing of 0 and a tilt of 0.
Do not change the camera with this camera update until the map has undergone layout (in
order for this method to correctly determine the appropriate bounding box and zoom level, the
map must have a size). Otherwise an IllegalStateException [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/reference/java/lang/IllegalStateException.html] will be thrown. It is NOT
sufficient for the map to be available; the view containing the map must have also undergone
layout such that its dimensions have been determined. If you cannot be sure that this has
occurred, use newLatLngBounds(LatLngBounds, int, int, int) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdateFactory#newLatLngBounds(com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLngBounds,%20int,%20int,%20int)] instead and provide the
dimensions of the map manually.

Parameters
| bounds | region to fit on screen |
| --- | --- |
| padding | space (in px) to leave between the bounding box edges and the view edges. This value is applied to all four sides of the bounding box. |

Returns
a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] containing the transformation.

newLatLngBounds
(LatLngBounds [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLngBounds] bounds, int width, int height, int padding)

Returns a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] that transforms the camera such that the specified
latitude/longitude bounds are centered on screen within a bounding box of specified dimensions
at the greatest possible zoom level. You can specify additional padding, to further restrict
the size of the bounding box. The returned CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] has a bearing of 0 and a tilt
of 0.
Unlike newLatLngBounds(LatLngBounds, int) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdateFactory#newLatLngBounds(com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLngBounds,%20int)], you can use the CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate]
returned by this method to change the camera prior to the map's the layout phase, because the
arguments specify the desired size of the bounding box.

Parameters
| bounds | the region to fit in the bounding box |
| --- | --- |
| width | bounding box width in pixels (px) |
| height | bounding box height in pixels (px) |
| padding | additional size restriction (in px) of the bounding box |

Returns
a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] containing the transformation.

newLatLngZoom
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] latLng, float zoom)

Returns a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] that moves the center of the screen to a latitude and longitude
specified by a LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] object, and moves to the given zoom level.

Parameters
| latLng | a LatLng object containing the desired latitude and longitude. |
| --- | --- |
| zoom | the desired zoom level, in the range of 2.0 to 21.0. Values below this range are set to 2.0, and values above it are set to 21.0. Increase the value to zoom in. Not all areas have tiles at the largest zoom levels. |

Returns
a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] containing the transformation.

CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate]

scrollBy
(float xPixel, float yPixel)

Returns a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] that scrolls the camera over the map, shifting the center of
view by the specified number of pixels in the x and y directions.
Examples:

If xPixel = 5 and yPixel = 0, the system scrolls right by moving the camera so that the
map appears to have shifted 5 pixels to the left.
If xPixel = 0 and yPixel = 5, the system scrolls down by moving the camera so that the
map appears to have shifted 5 pixels upwards.

The scrolling is relative to the camera's current orientation. For example, if the camera is
bearing 90 degrees, then east is "up" and scrolling right will move the camera south.

Parameters
| xPixel | the number of pixels to scroll horizontally. A positive value moves the camera to the right, with respect to its current orientation. A negative value moves the camera to the left, with respect to its current orientation. |
| --- | --- |
| yPixel | the number of pixels to scroll vertically. A positive value moves the camera downwards, with respect to its current orientation. A negative value moves the camera upwards, with respect to its current orientation. |

Returns
a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] containing the transformation.

zoomBy
(float amount, Point focus)

Returns a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] that shifts the zoom level of the current camera viewpoint.
A point specified by focus will remain fixed (i.e., it corresponds to the same lat/long both
before and after the zoom process).
This method is different to zoomTo(float) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdateFactory#zoomTo(float)] in that zoom is relative to the current
camera.
For example, if the LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] (11.11, 22.22) is currently at the screen location (23,
45). After calling this method with a zoom amount and this LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng], the screen location
of this LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] will still be (23, 45).

Parameters
| amount | amount to change the zoom level. Positive values indicate zooming closer to the surface of the Earth while negative values indicate zooming away from the surface of the Earth. |
| --- | --- |
| focus | pixel location on the screen that is to remain fixed after the zooming process. The lat/long that was at that pixel location before the camera move will remain the same after the camera has moved. |

Returns
a CameraUpdate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdate] containing the transformation.
