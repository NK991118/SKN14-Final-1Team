extends Object

An icon placed at a particular point on the map's surface. A marker icon is drawn oriented
against the device's screen rather than the map's surface; i.e., it will not necessarily change
orientation due to map rotations, tilting, or zooming.
A marker has the following properties:

Alpha
Sets the opacity of the marker. Defaults to 1.0.
Anchor
The point on the image that will be placed at the LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] position of the marker.
This defaults to 50% from the left of the image and at the bottom of the image.
Position
The LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] value for the marker's position on the map. You can change this value at
any time if you want to move the marker.
Title
A text string that's displayed in an info window when the user taps the marker. You can
change this value at any time.
Snippet
Additional text that's displayed below the title. You can change this value at any time.
Icon
A bitmap that's displayed for the marker. If the icon is left unset, a default icon is
displayed. You can specify an alternative coloring of the default icon using BitmapDescriptorFactory.defaultMarker(float) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/BitmapDescriptorFactory#defaultMarker(float)].
Drag Status
If you want to allow the user to drag the marker, set this property to true. You
can change this value at any time. The default is false.
Visibility
By default, the marker is visible. To make the marker invisible, set this property to
false. You can change this value at any time.
Flat or Billboard
If the marker is flat against the map, it will always be drawn facing the camera and will
rotate and tilt with the camera, unlike a GroundOverlay [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/GroundOverlay]. If the marker is a
billboard, it will remain stuck to the map as the camera rotates and tilts. As with flat
markers, billboard markers retain their size when the map is zoomed in or out. The default
is a billboard (false)
Rotation
The rotation of the marker in degrees clockwise about the marker's anchor point. The axis
of rotation is perpendicular to the marker. A rotation of 0 corresponds to the default
position of the marker. When the marker is flat on the map, the default position is North
aligned and the rotation is such that the marker always remains flat on the map. When the
marker is a billboard, the default position is pointing up and the rotation is such that
the marker is always facing the camera. The default value is 0.
zIndex
The draw order for the marker. The markers are drawn in order of the zIndex, with the
highest zIndex marker drawn on top. By setting the zIndex property for each marker, you can
control which tap target your user is most likely to hit. The default value is 0.
Tag
An Object associated with the marker. For example, the Object can contain
data about what the marker represents. This is easier than storing a separate Map<Marker, Object>. As another example, you can associate a String ID
corresponding to the ID from a data set. Google Maps SDK for Android neither reads nor
writes this property.

Methods in this class must be called on the Android UI thread. If not, an IllegalStateException [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/reference/java/lang/IllegalStateException.html] will be thrown at runtime.
Example
GoogleMap map = ... // get a map.
Marker marker = map.addMarker(new MarkerOptions()
.position(new LatLng(37.7750, 122.4183))
.title("San Francisco")
.snippet("Population: 776733"));

long pressing on the marker.

Returns
true if the marker is draggable; otherwise, returns false.

public

whether or not the info window is actually visible on screen.

public

Removes this marker from the map. After a marker has been removed, the behavior of all its
methods is undefined.

public
void

setAlpha
(float alpha)

Sets the alpha (opacity) of the marker. This is a value from 0 to 1, where 0 means the marker
is completely transparent and 1 means the marker is completely opaque.

Parameters
| alpha |  |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setAnchor
(float anchorU, float anchorV)

Sets the anchor point for the marker.
The anchor specifies the point in the icon image that is anchored to the marker's position
on the Earth's surface.
The anchor point is specified in the continuous space [0.0, 1.0] x [0.0, 1.0], where (0, 0)
is the top-left corner of the image, and (1, 1) is the bottom-right corner. The anchoring point
in a W x H image is the nearest discrete grid point in a (W + 1)  x
(H + 1) grid, obtained by scaling the then rounding. For example, in a 4 x 2 image,
the anchor point (0.7, 0.6) resolves to the grid point at (3, 1).

public
void

setDraggable
(boolean draggable)

Sets the draggability of the marker. When a marker is draggable, it can be moved by the user by
long pressing on the marker.

Parameters
| draggable |  |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setIcon
(BitmapDescriptor [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/BitmapDescriptor] iconDescriptor)

Sets the icon for the marker.

Parameters

| --- | --- |

public
void

setInfoWindowAnchor
(float anchorU, float anchorV)

Specifies the point in the marker image at which to anchor the info window when it is
displayed. This is specified in the same coordinate system as the anchor. See setAnchor(float, float) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker#setAnchor(float,%20float)] for more details. The default is the top middle of the image.

Parameters
| anchorU | u-coordinate of the info window anchor, as a ratio of the image width (in the range [0, 1]). |
| --- | --- |
| anchorV | v-coordinate of the info window anchor, as a ratio of the image height (in the range [0, 1]). |

public
void

setPosition
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] latlng)

Sets the location of the marker.

Parameters
| latlng |  |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setRotation
(float rotation)

Sets the rotation of the marker in degrees clockwise about the marker's anchor point. The axis
of rotation is perpendicular to the marker. A rotation of 0 corresponds to the default position
of the marker.

Parameters
| rotation |  |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setSnippet
(String snippet)

Sets the snippet of the marker.

Parameters
| snippet | if null, the snippet is cleared. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setTag
(Object tag)

Sets the tag for the marker.
You can use this property to associate an arbitrary Object with this marker. For
example, the Object can contain data about what the marker represents. This is easier
than storing a separate Map<Marker, Object>. As another example, you can associate a
String ID corresponding to the ID from a data set. Google Maps SDK for Android neither
reads nor writes this property. It is your responsibility to call setTag(null) to clear
the tag when you no longer need it, to prevent memory leaks in your app.

Parameters
| tag | if null, the tag is cleared. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setTitle
(String title)

Sets the title of the marker.

Parameters
| title | if null, the title is cleared. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setVisible
(boolean visible)

Sets the visibility of this marker. If set to false and an info window is currently
showing for this marker, this will hide the info window.

Parameters
| visible |  |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setZIndex
(float zIndex)

Sets the zIndex of the marker.

Parameters
| zIndex |  |
| --- | --- |

public
void

showInfoWindow
()

Shows the info window of this marker on the map, if this marker isVisible() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker#isVisible()].

Throws
| IllegalArgumentException | if marker is not on this map |
