소개

Distance Matrix API 요청의 형식은 다음과 같습니다.
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/outputFormat?parameters

여기서 outputFormat은 다음 값 중 하나일 수 있습니다.

json (권장)은 JavaScript 객체 표기법 (JSON)으로 출력을 나타냅니다.
xml은 출력을 XML로 나타냅니다.

참고: 유효한 URL이 되려면 올바르게 인코딩 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/web-service-best-practices?hl=ko#BuildingURLs]되어야 하며 모든 웹 서비스에서 16384자로 제한됩니다. URL을 구성할 때 이 제한에 유의하세요. 브라우저, 프록시, 서버마다 URL 문자 제한이 다를 수 있습니다.
필수인 매개변수와 선택사항인 매개변수가 있습니다. URL에서와 마찬가지로 모든 매개변수는 앰퍼샌드(&) 문자를 사용하여 구분합니다. 모든 예약된 문자 (예: 더하기 기호 '+')는 URL로 인코딩 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/web-service-best-practices?hl=ko#BuildingURLs]되어야 합니다. 매개변수 목록과 가능한 값은 아래에 열거되어 있습니다.

Required parametersdestinations
One or more locations to use as the finishing point for calculating travel
distance and time. The options for the destinations parameter are the same
as for the origins parameter.
origins
The starting point for calculating travel distance and time. You can
supply one or more locations separated by the pipe character (|), in the
form of a place ID, an address, or latitude/longitude coordinates:
Place ID: If you supply a place ID, you must prefix it
with place_id:.
Address: If you pass an address, the service geocodes
the string and converts it to a latitude/longitude coordinate to
calculate distance. This coordinate may be different from that returned
by the Geocoding API, for example a building entrance rather than its
center.

Note: using place IDs is preferred over using addresses or
latitude/longitude coordinates. Using coordinates will always result
in the point being snapped to the road nearest to those coordinates -
which may not be an access point to the property, or even a road that
will quickly or safely lead to the destination. Using the address will
provide the distance to the center of the building, as opposed to an
entrance to the building.
Coordinates: If you pass latitude/longitude
coordinates, they they will snap to the nearest road. Passing a place ID
is preferred. If you do pass coordinates, ensure that no space exists
between the latitude and longitude values.
Plus codes must be formatted as a global code or a
compound code. Format plus codes as shown here (plus signs are
url-escaped to %2B and spaces are url-escaped to %20):
global code is a 4 character area code and 6
character or longer local code (849VCWC8+R9 is encoded
to 849VCWC8%2BR9).
compound code is a 6 character or longer local code
with an explicit location (CWC8+R9 Mountain View, CA, USA
is encoded to CWC8%2BR9%20Mountain%20View%20CA%20USA).
Encoded Polyline Alternatively, you can supply an
encoded set of coordinates using the
Encoded Polyline Algorithm [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm?hl=ko]. This is particularly useful if you have a large number of origin
points, because the URL is significantly shorter when using an encoded
polyline.

Encoded polylines must be prefixed with enc: and
followed by a colon :. For example:
origins=enc:gfo}EtohhU:
You can also include multiple encoded polylines, separated by the
pipe character |. For example:
origins=enc:wc~oAwquwMdlTxiKtqLyiK:|enc:c~vnAamswMvlTor@tjGi}L:|enc:udymA{~bxM:
Optional parametersarrival_time
Specifies the desired time of arrival for transit directions, in seconds
since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. You can specify either
departure_time or arrival_time, but not both.
Note that arrival_time must be specified as an integer.
avoid
Distances may be calculated that adhere to certain restrictions.
Restrictions are indicated by use of the avoid parameter, and an argument
to that parameter indicating the restriction to avoid. The following
restrictions are supported:
tolls indicates that the calculated route should avoid toll
roads/bridges.
highways indicates that the calculated route should avoid
highways.
ferries indicates that the calculated route should avoid
ferries.
indoor indicates that the calculated route should avoid
indoor steps for walking and transit directions.
It's possible to request a route that avoids any combination of tolls, highways and ferries
by passing both restrictions to the avoid parameter. For example avoid=tolls|highways|ferries.

Note: The addition of restrictions does not preclude routes that include
the restricted feature; it biases the result to more favorable routes.
departure_time
Specifies the desired time of departure. You can specify the time as an
integer in seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. If a
departure_time later than 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z is
specified, the API will fall back the departure_time to
9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. Alternatively, you can specify a value of
now, which sets the departure time to the current time (correct to the
nearest second). The departure time may be specified in two cases:

For requests where the travel mode is transit: You can optionally
specify one of departure_time or arrival_time.
If neither time is specified, the departure_time defaults
to now (that is, the departure time defaults to the current time).

For requests where the travel mode is driving: You can specify the
departure_time to receive a route and trip duration
(response field: duration_in_traffic) that take traffic conditions into
account. The departure_time must be set to the current time
or some time in the future. It cannot be in the past.

Note: If departure time is not specified, choice of route and duration are
based on road network and average time-independent traffic conditions.
Results for a given request may vary over time due to changes in the road
network, updated average traffic conditions, and the distributed nature of
the service. Results may also vary between nearly-equivalent routes at any
time or frequency.

Note: Distance Matrix requests specifying departure_time when
mode=driving are limited to a maximum of 100 elements per request. The
number of origins times the number of destinations defines the number of
elements.
languageThe language in which to return results.
See the
list of supported languages [https://developers.google.com/maps/faq?hl=ko#languagesupport]. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
exhaustive.

If language is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
preferred language as specified in the
Accept-Language header.

The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
component.

If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
closest match.

The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
valid in one language but not in another. For example, utca and
tér are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
mode
For the calculation of distances and directions, you may specify the
transportation mode to use. By default, DRIVING mode is used.
By default, directions are calculated as driving directions. The following
travel modes are supported:
driving (default) indicates standard driving directions or
distance using the road network.
walking requests walking directions or distance via
pedestrian paths & sidewalks (where available).
bicycling requests bicycling directions or distance via
bicycle paths & preferred streets (where available).
transit requests directions or distance using public transit routes (where
available). If you set the mode to transit, you can optionally specify either a
departure_time or an arrival_time. If neither time is specified,
the departure_time defaults to now (that is, the departure time defaults to
the current time). You can also optionally include a transit_mode and/or a
transit_routing_preference.

Note: Both walking and bicycling directions may sometimes not include
clear pedestrian or bicycling paths, so these directions will return
warnings in the returned result which you must display to the user.

Note: Transit trips are available for up to 7 days in the past or up to 100 days in
the future, subject to availability of transit information supplied by data providers.
Transit schedules change frequently, available transit trips may change over time and
there is no guarantee to provide consistent results for predictions far in advance.
region
The region code, specified as a
ccTLD ("top-level domain") [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains]
two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes,
with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is
"uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the
entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland").
traffic_model
Specifies the assumptions to use when calculating time in traffic. This
setting affects the value returned in the duration_in_traffic field in the
response, which contains the predicted time in traffic based on historical
averages. The traffic_model parameter may only be specified
for driving directions where the request includes a
departure_time. The available values for this parameter are:
best_guess (default) indicates that the returned
duration_in_traffic should be the best estimate of travel time given
what is known about both historical traffic conditions and live traffic.
Live traffic becomes more important the closer the
departure_time is to now.
pessimistic indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic
should be longer than the actual travel time on most days, though
occasional days with particularly bad traffic conditions may exceed this
value.
optimistic indicates that the returned duration_in_traffic
should be shorter than the actual travel time on most days, though
occasional days with particularly good traffic conditions may be faster
than this value.

The default value of best_guess will give the most useful
predictions for the vast majority of use cases. It is possible the
best_guess travel time prediction may be shorter than
optimistic, or alternatively, longer than
pessimistic, due to the way the
best_guess prediction model integrates live traffic
information.
transit_mode
Specifies one or more preferred modes of transit. This parameter may only
be specified for transit directions. The parameter supports the following
arguments:
bus indicates that the calculated route should prefer
travel by bus.
subway indicates that the calculated route should prefer
travel by subway.
train indicates that the calculated route should prefer
travel by train.
tram indicates that the calculated route should prefer
travel by tram and light rail.
rail indicates that the calculated route should prefer
travel by train, tram, light rail, and subway. This is equivalent to
transit_mode=train|tram|subway.

transit_routing_preference

Specifies preferences for transit routes. Using this parameter, you can
bias the options returned, rather than accepting the default best route
chosen by the API. This parameter may only be specified for transit
directions. The parameter supports the following arguments:
less_walking indicates that the calculated route should
prefer limited amounts of walking.
fewer_transfers indicates that the calculated route should
prefer a limited number of transfers.
unitsSpecifies the unit system to use when displaying results.
Note: this unit system setting only affects the text displayed within
distance fields. The distance fields also contain values which are always
expressed in meters.

DistanceMatrixRow| Field | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| elements | required | Array<DistanceMatrixElement> | When the Distance Matrix API returns results, it places them within a JSON rows array. Even if no results are returned (such as when the origins and/or destinations don't exist), it still returns an empty array. Rows are ordered according to the values in the origin parameter of the request. Each row corresponds to an origin, and each element within that row corresponds to a pairing of the origin with a destination value. Each row array contains one or more element entries, which in turn contain the information about a single origin-destination pairing. See DistanceMatrixElement for more information. |

DistanceMatrixElement| Field | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| status | required | DistanceMatrixElementStatus | A status for the element. See DistanceMatrixElementStatus for more information. |
| distance | optional | TextValueObject | The total distance of this route, expressed in meters (value) and as text. The textual value uses the unit system specified with the unit parameter of the original request, or the origin's region. See TextValueObject for more information. |
| duration | optional | TextValueObject | The length of time it takes to travel this route, expressed in seconds (the value field) and as text. The textual representation is localized according to the query's language parameter. See TextValueObject for more information. |
| duration_in_traffic | optional | TextValueObject | The length of time it takes to travel this route, based on current and historical traffic conditions. See the traffic_model request parameter for the options you can use to request that the returned value is optimistic, pessimistic, or a best-guess estimate.
