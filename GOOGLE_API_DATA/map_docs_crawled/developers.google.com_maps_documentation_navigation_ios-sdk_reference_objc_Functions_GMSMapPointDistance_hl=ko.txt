GMSMapPointDistance

extern double GMSMapPointDistance(GMSMapPoint [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSMapPoint.html] a, GMSMapPoint [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSMapPoint.html] b)

Returns the length of the segment [a, b] in projected space.

The length is computed along the short path between the points potentially crossing the date
line. E.g. the distance between the points corresponding to San Francisco and Tokyo measures the
segment that passes north of Hawaii crossing the date line.
