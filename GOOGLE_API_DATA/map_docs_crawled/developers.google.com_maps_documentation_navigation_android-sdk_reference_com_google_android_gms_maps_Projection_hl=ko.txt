public  final   class
Projection
extends Object

A projection is used to translate between on screen location and geographic coordinates on the
surface of the Earth (LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng]). Screen location is in screen pixels (not display pixels)
with respect to the top left corner of the map (and not necessarily of the whole screen).

Public Method Summary
| LatLng | fromScreenLocation(Point point) Returns the geographic location that corresponds to a screen location. |
| --- | --- |
| VisibleRegion | getVisibleRegion() Gets a projection of the viewing frustum for converting between screen coordinates and geo-latitude/longitude coordinates. |
| Point | toScreenLocation(LatLng location) Returns a screen location that corresponds to a geographical coordinate (LatLng). |

Public Methods

public
LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng]

fromScreenLocation
(Point point)

Returns the geographic location that corresponds to a screen location. The screen location is
specified in screen pixels (not display pixels) relative to the top left of the map (not the
top left of the whole screen).

Parameters
| point | A Point on the screen in screen pixels. |
| --- | --- |

Returns
The LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] corresponding to the point on the screen, or null if
the ray through the given screen point does not intersect the ground plane (this might be
the case if the map is heavily tilted).

public
VisibleRegion [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/VisibleRegion]

getVisibleRegion
()

Gets a projection of the viewing frustum for converting between screen coordinates and
geo-latitude/longitude coordinates.

Returns
The projection of the viewing frustum in its current state.

public
Point

toScreenLocation
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] location)

Returns a screen location that corresponds to a geographical coordinate (LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng]). The
screen location is in screen pixels (not display pixels) relative to the top left of the map
(not of the whole screen).

Parameters
| location | A LatLng on the map to convert to a screen location. |
| --- | --- |

Returns
A Point [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Point.html] representing the screen location in screen pixels.
