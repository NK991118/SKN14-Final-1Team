GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint

@interface GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint : GMSNavigationWaypoint [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint.html]

A mutable waypoint class.

preferSameSideOfRoad [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint(py)preferSameSideOfRoad]

Whether it is preferred to route the driver to the same side of the road. The route will arrive
on the preferred side of the road unless there is a significant delay caused by a road closure
or slow-moving traffic. Default to NO.
Setting this to true clears any value in preferredHeading [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint.html#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint(py)preferredHeading].

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) BOOL preferSameSideOfRoad;

preferredHeading [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint(py)preferredHeading]

An angle used to express the direction of traffic on the side of the road that the vehicle
should arrive on. Consequently, it is not useful for one-way streets.
Units expressed in degrees [0, 360], where 0 means North and angles increase clockwise.
Default and unset value is -1.
Setting a valid value will clear the preferSameSideOfRoad [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint.html#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint(py)preferSameSideOfRoad].

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) int32_t preferredHeading;

vehicleStopover [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint(py)vehicleStopover]

Indicates that the waypoint is meant for vehicles to stop at, where the intention is to either
pickup or drop-off. When you set this value, waypoints on roads that are unsuitable for pickup
and drop-off may be adjusted to a more suitable location. This option works only for DRIVE and
TWO_WHEELER travel modes. Default to NO.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) BOOL vehicleStopover;
