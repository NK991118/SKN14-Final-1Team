GroundOverlay
extends Object

A ground overlay is an image that is fixed to a map. A ground overlay has the following
properties:

Position
There are two ways to specify the position of the ground overlay:

Using a location: You must provide an image of the ground overlay, a LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng]
to which the anchor will be fixed and the width of the overlay (in meters). The
anchor is, by default, 50% from the top of the image and 50% from the left of the
image. This can be changed. You can optionally provide the height of the overlay (in
meters). If you do not provide the height of the overlay, it will be automatically
calculated to preserve the proportions of the image.
Using a Bounds: You must provide a LatLngBounds [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLngBounds] which will contain the image.

You must specify the position of the ground overlay before it is added to the map,
otherwise an IllegalArgumentException [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/reference/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html] will be thrown when the ground overlay is
added to the map. Furthermore, you must only specify the position using one of these
methods in the GroundOverlayOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/GroundOverlayOptions] object; otherwise an IllegalStateException [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/reference/java/lang/IllegalStateException.html] will be thrown when specifying using a second method.
Image
The image (as an BitmapDescriptor [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/BitmapDescriptor]) to be used for this overlay. The image will be
scaled to fit the position provided. You must specify an image before adding the ground
overlay to the map; if not an IllegalArgumentException [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/reference/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html] will be thrown when it is
added to the map.
Bearing
The amount that the image should be rotated in a clockwise direction. The center of the
rotation will be the image's anchor. This is optional and the default bearing is 0, i.e.,
the image is aligned so that up is north.
zIndex
The order in which this ground overlay is drawn with respect to other overlays (including
Polyline [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Polyline]s and TileOverlay [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/TileOverlay]s, but not Marker [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker]s). An overlay with a
larger zIndex is drawn over overlays with smaller zIndexes. The order of overlays with the
same zIndex value is arbitrary. This is optional and the default zIndex is 0.
Transparency
Transparency of the ground overlay in the range [0..1] where 0 means the
overlay is opaque and 1 means the overlay is fully transparent. If the specified
bitmap is already partially transparent, the transparency of each pixel will be scaled
accordingly (for example, if a pixel in the bitmap has an alpha value of 200 and you
specify the transparency of the ground overlay as 0.25, then the pixel will be rendered on
the screen with an alpha value of 150). Specification of this property is optional and the
default transparency is 0 (opaque).
Visibility
Indicates if the ground overlay is visible or invisible, i.e. whether it is drawn on the
map. An invisible ground overlay is not drawn, but retains all of its other properties.
This is optional and the default visibility is true, i.e., visible.
Clickability
If you want to handle events fired when the user clicks the ground overlay, set this
property to true. You can change this value at any time. The default is false. If this property is set to true, your app will receive notifications to the
GoogleMap.OnGroundOverlayClickListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap.OnGroundOverlayClickListener] registered through GoogleMap.setOnGroundOverlayClickListener(GoogleMap.OnGroundOverlayClickListener) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#setOnGroundOverlayClickListener(com.google.android.gms.maps.GoogleMap.OnGroundOverlayClickListener)].
Tag
An Object associated with the ground overlay. For example, the Object can
contain data about what the ground overlay represents. This is easier than storing a
separate Map<GroundOverlay, Object>. As another example, you can associate a String ID corresponding to the ID from a data set. Google Maps SDK for Android neither
reads nor writes this property.

Methods in this class must be called on the Android UI thread. If not, an IllegalStateException [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/reference/java/lang/IllegalStateException.html] will be thrown at runtime.
Example
GoogleMap map = ...; // get a map.
BitmapDescriptor imageDescriptor = ...; // get an image.
LatLngBounds bounds = ...; // get a bounds
GroundOverlay groundOverlay = map.addGroundOverlay(new GroundOverlayOptions()
.image(imageDescriptor)
.positionFromBounds(bounds)
.transparency(0.5));

Parameters
| width | width in meters |
| --- | --- |
| height | height in meters |

public
void

setDimensions
(float width)

Sets the width of the ground overlay. The height of the ground overlay will be adapted
accordingly to preserve aspect ratio.

Parameters
| width | width in meters |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setImage
(BitmapDescriptor [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/BitmapDescriptor] imageDescriptor)

image.

Parameters
| imageDescriptor | the BitmapDescriptor to use for this ground overlay. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setPosition
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] latLng)

Sets the position of the ground overlay by changing the location of the anchor point. Preserves
all other properties of the image.

Parameters
| latLng | a LatLng that is the new location to place the anchor point. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setPositionFromBounds
(LatLngBounds [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLngBounds] bounds)

Sets the position of the ground overlay by fitting it to the given LatLngBounds [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLngBounds]. This
method will ignore the rotation (bearing) of the ground overlay when positioning it, but the
bearing will still be used when drawing it.

Parameters
| bounds | a LatLngBounds in which to place the ground overlay |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setTag
(Object tag)

Sets the tag for the ground overlay.
You can use this property to associate an arbitrary Object with this ground overlay.
For example, the Object can contain data about what the ground overlay represents. This
is easier than storing a separate Map<GroundOverlay, Object>. As another example, you
can associate a String ID corresponding to the ID from a data set. Google Maps SDK for
Android neither reads nor writes this property. It is your responsibility to call setTag(null) to clear the tag when you no longer need it, to prevent memory leaks in your app.

Parameters
| tag | if null, the tag is cleared. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setTransparency
(float transparency)

Sets the transparency of this ground overlay. See the documentation at the top of this class
for more information.

Parameters
| transparency | a float in the range [0..1] where 0 means that the ground overlay is opaque and 1 means that the ground overlay is transparent. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setVisible
(boolean visible)

Sets the visibility of this ground overlay. When not visible, a ground overlay is not drawn,
but it keeps all of its other properties.

Parameters
| visible | if true, then the ground overlay is visible; if false, it is not |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setZIndex
(float zIndex)

Sets the zIndex of this ground overlay. See the documentation at the top of this class for more
information.

Parameters
| zIndex | the zIndex of this ground overlay |
