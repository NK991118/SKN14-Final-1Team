public     class
SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment
extends Fragment

A StreetViewPanorama component in an app. This fragment is the simplest way to place a Street
View panorama in an application. It's a wrapper around a view of a panorama to automatically
handle the necessary life cycle needs. Being a fragment, this component can be added to an
activity's layout file simply with the XML below.
<fragment
class="com.google.android.gms.maps.SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment"
android:layout_width="match_parent"
android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
A StreetViewPanorama [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanorama] must be acquired using getStreetViewPanoramaAsync(OnStreetViewPanoramaReadyCallback) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment#getStreetViewPanoramaAsync(com.google.android.gms.maps.OnStreetViewPanoramaReadyCallback)]. The SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment] automatically initializes the Street View system and the view.
A view can be removed when the SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment's onDestroyView() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment#onDestroyView()] method is
called and the StreetViewPanoramaOptions.useViewLifecycleInFragment(boolean) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaOptions#useViewLifecycleInFragment(boolean)] option is
set. When this happens the SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment is no longer valid until the view is
recreated again later when MapFragment's onCreateView(LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment#onCreateView(android.view.LayoutInflater,%20android.view.ViewGroup,%20android.os.Bundle)]
method is called.
Any object obtained from the StreetViewPanorama [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanorama] is associated with the view. It's
important to not hold on to objects beyond the view's life. Otherwise it will cause a memory leak
as the view cannot be released.
Use this class only if you are targeting API 12 and above. Otherwise, use
SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment.
Note: The Google Maps SDK for Android does not support multiple
SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment objects in one activity.
