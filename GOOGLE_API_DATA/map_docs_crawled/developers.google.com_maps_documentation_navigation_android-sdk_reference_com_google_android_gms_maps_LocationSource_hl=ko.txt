public     interface
LocationSource

Defines an interface for providing location data, typically to a GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap] object.
A GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap] object has a built-in location provider for its my-location layer, but it
can be replaced [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#setLocationSource(com.google.android.gms.maps.LocationSource)] with another one that
implements this interface.
A GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap] object activates its location provider using activate(OnLocationChangedListener) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/LocationSource#activate(com.google.android.gms.maps.LocationSource.OnLocationChangedListener)]. While active (between activate(OnLocationChangedListener) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/LocationSource#activate(com.google.android.gms.maps.LocationSource.OnLocationChangedListener)] and deactivate() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/LocationSource#deactivate()]), a location provider should push
periodic location updates to the listener registered in activate(OnLocationChangedListener) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/LocationSource#activate(com.google.android.gms.maps.LocationSource.OnLocationChangedListener)]. It is the provider's responsibility to use location
services wisely according to the map's lifecycle state. For example, it should only using
battery-intensive services (like GPS) occasionally, or only while an activity is in the
foreground.

activate
(LocationSource.OnLocationChangedListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/LocationSource.OnLocationChangedListener] listener)

Activates this provider. This provider will notify the supplied listener periodically, until
you call deactivate() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/LocationSource#deactivate()]. Notifications will be broadcast on the main thread.

Parameters
| listener | listener that's called when a new location is available |
| --- | --- |

Throws
| IllegalStateException | if this provider is already active |
| --- | --- |
| IllegalArgumentException | if listener is null |
