getStamp
()

The image or texture to be repeated over a stroke.
The rendered stamps will be the width of the line that was set for the StrokeStyle. The
image will be oriented with the top of the image facing the start point, and the bottom of the
image facing the end point. For example, if the underlying line has two points and the start
point is directly above the endpoint, the stamp will appear in an upright orientation.

Returns
the bitmap image for this stamp style.
