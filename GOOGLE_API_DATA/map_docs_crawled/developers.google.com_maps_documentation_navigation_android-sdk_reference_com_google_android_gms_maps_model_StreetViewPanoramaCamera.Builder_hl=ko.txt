zoom
(float zoom)

Sets the zoom level of the camera. The original zoom level is set at 0. A zoom of 1 would
double the magnification. The zoom is clamped between 0 and the maximum zoom level. The
maximum zoom level can vary based upon the panorama. Clamped means that any value falling
outside this range will be set to the closest extreme that falls within the range. For
example, a value of -1 will be set to 0. Another example: If the maximum zoom for the
panorama is 19, and the value is given as 20, it will be set to 19. Note that the camera zoom
need not be an integer value.

Parameters
| zoom |  |
