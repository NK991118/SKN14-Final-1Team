Public Methods

public
boolean

isCompassEnabled
()

Gets whether the compass is enabled/disabled.

Returns
true if the compass is enabled; false if the compass is disabled.

public
boolean

isIndoorLevelPickerEnabled
()

Gets whether the indoor level picker is enabled/disabled. That is, whether the level picker
will appear when a building with indoor maps is focused.

Returns
true if the level picker is enabled; false if the level picker is
disabled.

public
boolean

isMapToolbarEnabled
()

Gets whether the Map Toolbar is enabled/disabled.

Returns
true if the Map Toolbar is enabled; false otherwise.

public
boolean

isMyLocationButtonEnabled
()

Gets whether the My Location button is enabled or disabled. Enabled by default. Requires
GoogleMap#isMyLocationEnabled to be set to true. The My Location button is a small crosshair
button that exists only in the map view. If enabled, the button appears in the map view. If
disabled, the button does not appear.
In navigation mode, the view displays a re-center button controlled by NavigationView.setRecenterButtonEnabled(boolean) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#setRecenterButtonEnabled(boolean)]. When in
navigation mode, this button appears instead of the My Location button.

Returns
true if the My Location button is enabled; false if the My Location
button is disabled.

public
boolean

isRotateGesturesEnabled
()

Gets whether rotate gestures are enabled/disabled.

Returns
true if rotate gestures are enabled; false if rotate gestures are
disabled.

public
boolean

isScrollGesturesEnabled
()

Gets whether scroll gestures are enabled/disabled.

Returns
true if scroll gestures are enabled; false if scroll gestures are
disabled.

public
boolean

isScrollGesturesEnabledDuringRotateOrZoom
()

Gets whether scroll gestures are enabled/disabled during rotation and zoom gestures.

Returns
true if scroll gestures are enabled during rotate or zoom gestures; false if scroll gestures are disabled during rotate or zoom gestures.

public
boolean

isTiltGesturesEnabled
()

Gets whether tilt gestures are enabled/disabled.

Returns
true if tilt gestures are enabled; false if tilt gestures are disabled.

public
boolean

isZoomControlsEnabled
()

Gets whether the zoom controls are enabled/disabled.

Returns
true if the zoom controls are enabled; false if the zoom controls are
disabled;

public
boolean

isZoomGesturesEnabled
()

Gets whether zoom gestures are enabled/disabled.

Returns
true if zoom gestures are enabled; false if zoom gestures are disabled.

public
void

setAllGesturesEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Sets the preference for whether all gestures should be enabled or disabled. If enabled, all
gestures are available; otherwise, all gestures are disabled. This doesn't restrict users from
tapping any on screen buttons to move the camera (e.g., compass or zoom controls), nor does it
restrict programmatic movements and animation.

Parameters
| enabled | true to enable all gestures; false to disable all gestures. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setCompassEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Enables or disables the compass. The compass is an icon on the map that indicates the direction
of north on the map. If enabled, it is only shown when the camera is tilted or rotated away
from its default orientation (tilt of 0 and a bearing of 0). When a user clicks the compass,
the camera orients itself to its default orientation and fades away shortly after. If disabled,
the compass will never be displayed.
By default, the compass is enabled (and hence shown when the camera is not in the default
orientation).

Parameters
| enabled | true to enable the compass; false to disable the compass. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setIndoorLevelPickerEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Sets whether the indoor level picker is enabled when indoor mode is enabled. If true,
the level picker will appear when a building with indoor maps is focused. If false, no
level picker will appear - an application will need to provide its own way of selecting levels.
The default behaviour is to show the level picker.

Parameters
| enabled | true to show; false to hide the level picker. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setMapToolbarEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Sets the preference for whether the Map Toolbar should be enabled or disabled. If enabled, and
the Map Toolbar can be shown in the current context, users will see a bar with various
context-dependent actions, including 'open this map in the Google Maps app' and 'find
directions to the highlighted marker in the Google Maps app'.
By default, the Map Toolbar is enabled.

Parameters
| enabled | true to enable the Map Toolbar; false to disable the Map Toolbar. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setMyLocationButtonEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Enables or disables the my-location button. The my-location button causes the camera to move
such that the user's location is in the center of the map. If the button is enabled, it is only
shown when the my-location layer is enabled.
By default, the my-location button is enabled (and hence shown when the my-location layer is
enabled).

Parameters
| enabled | true to enable the my-location button; false to disable the my-location button. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setRotateGesturesEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Sets the preference for whether rotate gestures should be enabled or disabled. If enabled,
users can use a two-finger rotate gesture to rotate the camera. If disabled, users cannot
rotate the camera via gestures. This setting doesn't restrict the user from tapping the compass
icon to reset the camera orientation, nor does it restrict programmatic movements and animation
of the camera.
By default, rotate gestures are enabled.

Parameters
| enabled | true to enable rotate; false to disable rotate gestures. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setScrollGesturesEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Sets the preference for whether scroll gestures should be enabled or disabled. If enabled,
users can swipe to pan the camera. If disabled, swiping has no effect. This setting doesn't
restrict programmatic movement and animation of the camera.
By default, scroll gestures are enabled.

Parameters
| enabled | true to enable scroll gestures; false to disable scroll gestures. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setScrollGesturesEnabledDuringRotateOrZoom
(boolean enabled)

Sets the preference for whether scroll gestures can take place at the same time as a zoom or
rotate gesture. If enabled, users can scroll the map while rotating or zooming the map. If
disabled, the map cannot be scrolled while the user rotates or zooms the map using gestures.
This setting doesn't disable scroll gestures entirely, only during rotation and zoom gestures,
nor does it restrict programmatic movements and animation of the camera.
By default, scroll gestures are enabled during rotation and zoom.

Parameters
| enabled | true to enable scroll gestures during rotate or zoom gestures; false to disable scroll gestures during rotate or zoom gestures. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setTiltGesturesEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Sets the preference for whether tilt gestures should be enabled or disabled. If enabled, users
can use a two-finger vertical down swipe to tilt the camera. If disabled, users cannot tilt the
camera via gestures. This setting doesn't restrict users from tapping the compass icon to reset
the camera orientation, nor does it restrict programmatic movement and animation of the camera.
By default, tilt gestures are enabled.

Parameters
| enabled | true to enable tilt gestures; false to disable tilt gestures. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setZoomControlsEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Enables or disables the zoom controls. If enabled, the zoom controls are a pair of buttons (one
for zooming in, one for zooming out) that appear on the screen. When pressed, they cause the
camera to zoom in (or out) by one zoom level. If disabled, the zoom controls are not shown.
By default, the zoom controls are enabled.

Parameters
| enabled | true to enable the zoom controls; false to disable the zoom controls. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setZoomGesturesEnabled
(boolean enabled)

Sets the preference for whether zoom gestures should be enabled or disabled. If enabled, users
can either double tap/two-finger tap or pinch to zoom the camera. If disabled, these gestures
have no effect. This setting doesn't affect the zoom buttons, nor does it restrict programmatic
movement and animation of the camera.
By default, zoom gestures are enabled.

Parameters
| enabled | true to enable zoom gestures; false to disable zoom gestures. |
