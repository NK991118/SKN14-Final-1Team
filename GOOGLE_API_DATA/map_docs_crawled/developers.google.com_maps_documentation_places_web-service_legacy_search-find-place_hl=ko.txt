이 서비스 이용에 적용됩니다. 기능은 리전에 따라 다릅니다.
자세히 알아보기 [https://developers.google.com/maps/comms/eea/faq?hl=ko]

참고: 서버 측 및 클라이언트 측 라이브러리

Places API는 Google 지도 서비스용 Java 클라이언트, Python 클라이언트, Go 클라이언트, Node.js 클라이언트 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/client-library?hl=ko]에서도 사용할 수 있습니다.
Places API 및 클라이언트 라이브러리는 서버 애플리케이션에서 사용하기 위한 것입니다.

클라이언트 측 애플리케이션을 빌드하는 경우 Android용 Places SDK (신규) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk?hl=ko], iOS용 Places SDK (신규) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk?hl=ko], Maps JavaScript API의 장소 라이브러리 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places?hl=ko]를 참고하세요.

Find Place (기존) 요청은 텍스트 입력을 받아 장소를 반환합니다. 이름, 주소, 전화번호 등 모든 유형의 장소 텍스트 데이터를 입력할 수 있습니다. 요청은 문자열이어야 합니다. 위도/경도 좌표나 플러스 코드와 같은 비문자열 데이터를 사용하는 Find Place (기존) 요청은 오류를 생성합니다.

장소 검색 (레거시) 요청은 장소 세부정보 (레거시) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details?hl=ko] 요청에서 반환하는 필드의 하위 집합을 반환합니다.
Find Place (Legacy) 요청에서 사용할 수 없는 필드에 대한 자세한 내용은 Places API 필드 지원 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-data-fields?hl=ko#places-api-fields-support]을 참고하세요.
원하는 필드가 반환되지 않는 경우 Find Place (기존)를 사용하여 place_id를 가져온 다음 이 ID를 사용하여 Place Details (기존)를 요청할 수 있습니다.

장소 찾기 (기존) 요청

장소 찾기 (레거시) 요청은 다음 형식의 HTTP URL입니다.

https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/findplacefromtext/output?parameters

여기서 output은 다음 값 중 하나일 수 있습니다.

json (권장)은 JavaScript 객체 표기법 (JSON)의 출력을 나타냅니다.
xml는 XML로 출력을 나타냅니다.

장소 찾기 (기존) 요청을 시작하려면 특정 매개변수가 필요합니다. URL에서와 마찬가지로 모든 매개변수는 앰퍼샌드(&) 문자를 사용하여 구분합니다.

Required parametersinput
The text string on which to search, for example: "restaurant" or "123 Main
Street". This must be a place name, address, or category of
establishments. Any other types of input can generate errors and are not
guaranteed to return valid results. The Places API will return candidate
matches based on this string and order the results based on their
perceived relevance.
inputtype
The type of input. This can be one of either textquery or
phonenumber. Phone numbers must be in international format
(prefixed by a plus sign ("+"), followed by the country code, then the
phone number itself). See
E.164 ITU recommendation [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164]
for more information.
Optional parametersfields
Caution: Place Search requests and Place Details requests do not return
the same fields. Place Search requests return a subset of the fields that
are returned by Place Details requests. If the field you want is not
returned by Place Search, you can use Place Search to get a
place_id, then use that Place ID to make a Place Details
request. For more information on the fields that are unavailable in a
Place Search request, see
Places API fields support [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-data-fields?hl=ko#places-api-fields-support].

Use the fields parameter to specify a comma-separated list of place data
types to return. For example:
fields=formatted_address,name,geometry. Use a forward slash
when specifying compound values. For example:
opening_hours/open_now.

Fields are divided into three billing categories: Basic, Contact, and
Atmosphere. Basic fields are billed at base rate, and incur no additional
charges. Contact and Atmosphere fields are billed at a higher rate. See
the
pricing sheet [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing/?hl=ko]
for more information. Attributions, html_attributions, are
always returned with every call, regardless of whether the field has been
requested.
Basic
The Basic category includes the following fields:
address_components, adr_address,
business_status, formatted_address,
geometry, icon, icon_mask_base_uri,
icon_background_color, name,
permanently_closed (deprecated [https://developers.google.com/maps/deprecations?hl=ko]), photo, place_id, plus_code,
type, url, utc_offset,
vicinity, wheelchair_accessible_entrance.
Contact
The Contact category includes the following fields:
current_opening_hours, formatted_phone_number,
international_phone_number, opening_hours,
secondary_opening_hours, websiteAtmosphere
The Atmosphere category includes the following fields:
curbside_pickup, delivery, dine_in,
editorial_summary, price_level,
rating, reservable, reviews,
serves_beer, serves_breakfast,
serves_brunch, serves_dinner,
serves_lunch, serves_vegetarian_food,
serves_wine, takeout,
user_ratings_total.
languageThe language in which to return results.
See the
list of supported languages [https://developers.google.com/maps/faq?hl=ko#languagesupport]. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
exhaustive.

If language is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
preferred language as specified in the
Accept-Language header.

The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
component.

If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
closest match.

The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
valid in one language but not in another. For example, utca and
tér are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
locationbias
Prefer results in a specified area, by specifying either a radius plus
lat/lng, or two lat/lng pairs representing the points of a rectangle. If
this parameter is not specified, the API uses IP address biasing by
default.

IP bias: Instructs the API to use IP address biasing. Pass the string
ipbias (this option has no additional parameters).

Circular: A string specifying radius in meters, plus lat/lng in decimal
degrees. Use the following format: circle:radius@lat,lng.

Rectangular: A string specifying two lat/lng pairs in decimal degrees,
representing the south/west and north/east points of a rectangle. Use
the following format:rectangle:south,west|north,east. Note
that east/west values are wrapped to the range -180, 180, and
north/south values are clamped to the range -90, 90.

참고: 장소 찾기 (기존) 요청에서 fields 매개변수를 생략하면 결과의 place_id만 반환됩니다.
