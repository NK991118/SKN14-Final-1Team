public

LatLng
(double latitude, double longitude)

Constructs a LatLng with the given latitude and longitude, measured in degrees.

Parameters
| latitude | The point's latitude. This will be clamped to between -90 degrees and +90 degrees inclusive. |
| --- | --- |
| longitude | The point's longitude. This will be normalized to be within -180 degrees inclusive and +180 degrees exclusive. |

Public Methods

public
boolean

equals
(Object o)

Tests if this LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] is equal to another.
Two points are considered equal if and only if their latitudes are bitwise equal and their
longitudes are bitwise equal. This means that two LatLngs that are very near, in terms
of geometric distance, might not be considered .equal().

Parameters
