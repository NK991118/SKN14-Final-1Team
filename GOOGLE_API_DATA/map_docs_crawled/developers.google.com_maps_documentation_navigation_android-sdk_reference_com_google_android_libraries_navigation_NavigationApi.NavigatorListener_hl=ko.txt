NavigationApi.NavigatorListener

Register a NavigatorListener with NavigationApi.getNavigator(Activity, NavigatorListener) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationApi#getNavigator(android.app.Activity,%20com.google.android.libraries.navigation.NavigationApi.NavigatorListener)] to be
notified about the status of said Navigator [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator]. Note that only one of NavigatorListener's
methods will be called, and that all calls occur on the UI thread.
Note: That method may be called after Activity.finish() [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#finish()], and a check against Activity.isFinishing() [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#isFinishing()] or Activity.isDestroyed() [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#isDestroyed()] may be necessary before some
operations. For example, during a rapid succession of context changes.
