MarkerOptions
()

Creates a new set of marker options.

Public Methods

public
MarkerOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/MarkerOptions]

alpha
(float alpha)

Sets the alpha (opacity) of the marker. This is a value from 0 to 1, where 0 means the marker
is completely transparent and 1 means the marker is completely opaque.

Parameters
| alpha |  |
| --- | --- |

Returns
the object for which the method was called, with the new alpha set.

public
MarkerOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/MarkerOptions]

anchor
(float u, float v)

Specifies the anchor to be at a particular point in the marker image.
The anchor specifies the point in the icon image that is anchored to the marker's position
on the Earth's surface.
The anchor point is specified in the continuous space [0.0, 1.0] x [0.0, 1.0], where (0, 0)
is the top-left corner of the image, and (1, 1) is the bottom-right corner. The anchoring point
in a W x H image is the nearest discrete grid point in a (W + 1)  x
(H + 1) grid, obtained by scaling the then rounding. For example, in a 4 x 2 image,
the anchor point (0.7, 0.6) resolves to the grid point at (3, 1).

|     |     |     |     |
*-----+-----+-----+-----*

Parameters
| u | u-coordinate of the anchor, as a ratio of the image width (in the range [0, 1]) |
| --- | --- |
| v | v-coordinate of the anchor, as a ratio of the image height (in the range [0, 1]) |

Returns
the object for which the method was called, with the new anchor set.

MarkerOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/MarkerOptions]

collisionBehavior
(int collisionBehavior)

This method is deprecated. No replacement.

Sets the collision state for the marker. This is a value of Marker.CollisionBehavior [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker.CollisionBehavior]. It can
only be set once.

Parameters
| collisionBehavior |  |
| --- | --- |

Returns
the object for which the method was called, with the collision state set.

public
MarkerOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/MarkerOptions]

contentDescription
(String contentDescription)

Sets the content description of the marker. This text may be read aloud if android's talkback
accessibility feature is enabled.
This API does not apply to the Navigation SDK. It exists for compile time compatibility with
com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps only.

Parameters
| contentDescription |  |
| --- | --- |

Returns
the object for which the method was called, with the new content description set

public
MarkerOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/MarkerOptions]

draggable
(boolean draggable)

Sets the draggability for the marker.

Parameters
| draggable |  |
| --- | --- |

Returns
the object for which the method was called, with the new draggable state set.

public
MarkerOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/MarkerOptions]

flat
(boolean flat)

Sets whether this marker should be flat against the map true or a billboard facing the
camera false. If the marker is flat against the map, it will always be drawn facing the
camera and will rotate and tilt with the camera, unlike a GroundOverlay [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/GroundOverlay]. If the marker
is a billboard, it will remain stuck to the map as the camera rotates and tilts. Both flat and
billboard markers remain the same size as the camera zooms. The default value is false.

| --- | --- |

Returns
the object for which the method was called, with the new flat state set.
