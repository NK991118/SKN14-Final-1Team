GMSUISettings

@interface GMSUISettings : NSObject

Settings for the user interface of a GMSMapView.

-setAllGesturesEnabled: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSUISettings#/c:objc(cs)GMSUISettings(im)setAllGesturesEnabled:]

Sets the preference for whether all gestures should be enabled (default) or disabled. This
doesn’t restrict users from tapping any on screen buttons to move the camera (e.g., compass or
zoom controls), nor does it restrict programmatic movements and animation.

Declaration

Swift
func setAllGesturesEnabled(_ enabled: Bool)

Objective-C
- (void)setAllGesturesEnabled:(BOOL)enabled;

scrollGestures [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSUISettings#/c:objc(cs)GMSUISettings(py)scrollGestures]

Controls whether scroll gestures are enabled (default) or disabled. If enabled, users may drag to
pan the camera. This does not limit programmatic movement of the camera.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) BOOL scrollGestures;

zoomGestures [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSUISettings#/c:objc(cs)GMSUISettings(py)zoomGestures]

Controls whether zoom gestures are enabled (default) or disabled. If enabled, users may double
tap/two-finger tap or pinch to zoom the camera. This does not limit programmatic movement of the
camera.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) BOOL zoomGestures;

tiltGestures [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSUISettings#/c:objc(cs)GMSUISettings(py)tiltGestures]

Controls whether tilt gestures are enabled (default) or disabled. If enabled, users may use a
two-finger vertical down or up swipe to tilt the camera. This does not limit programmatic control
of the camera’s viewingAngle.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) BOOL tiltGestures;

rotateGestures [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSUISettings#/c:objc(cs)GMSUISettings(py)rotateGestures]

Controls whether rotate gestures are enabled (default) or disabled. If enabled, users may use a
two-finger rotate gesture to rotate the camera. This does not limit programmatic control of the
camera’s bearing.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) BOOL rotateGestures;

consumesGesturesInView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSUISettings#/c:objc(cs)GMSUISettings(py)consumesGesturesInView]

Controls whether gestures by users are completely consumed by the GMSMapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMapView.html] when gestures are
enabled (default YES).  This prevents these gestures from being received by parent views.

When the GMSMapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMapView.html] is contained by a UIScrollView (or other scrollable area), this means
that gestures on the map will not be additional consumed as scroll gestures.  However, disabling
this (set to NO) may be useful to support complex view hierarchies or requirements.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) BOOL consumesGesturesInView;

compassButton [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSUISettings#/c:objc(cs)GMSUISettings(py)compassButton]

Enables or disables the compass. The compass is an icon on the map that indicates the direction
of north on the map.

If enabled, it is only shown when the camera is rotated away from its default orientation
(bearing of 0). When a user taps the compass, the camera orients itself to its default
orientation and fades away shortly after. If disabled, the compass will never be displayed.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) BOOL compassButton;

myLocationButton [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSUISettings#/c:objc(cs)GMSUISettings(py)myLocationButton]

Enables or disables the My Location button. This is a button visible on the map that, when tapped
by users, will center the map on the current user location.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) BOOL myLocationButton;

indoorPicker [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSUISettings#/c:objc(cs)GMSUISettings(py)indoorPicker]

Enables (default) or disables the indoor floor picker.

If enabled, it is only visible when the view is focused on a building with indoor floor data. If
disabled, the selected floor can still be controlled programmatically via the indoorDisplay
mapView property.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) BOOL indoorPicker;

allowScrollGesturesDuringRotateOrZoom [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSUISettings#/c:objc(cs)GMSUISettings(py)allowScrollGesturesDuringRotateOrZoom]

Controls whether rotate and zoom gestures can be performed off-center and scrolled around
(default YES).

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) BOOL allowScrollGesturesDuringRotateOrZoom;
