GMSGeometrySignedArea

extern double GMSGeometrySignedArea(GMSPath [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPath.html] *_Nonnull path)

Returns the signed area of a geodesic polygon defined by path on Earth.

The result has the same absolute value as GMSGeometryArea(); it is positive if the points of
path are in counter-clockwise order, and negative otherwise.

The same restrictions as on GMSGeometryArea() apply.
