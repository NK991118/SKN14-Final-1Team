public static    interface
GoogleMap.OnMapLoadedCallback

Callback interface for when the map has finished rendering. This occurs after all tiles
required to render the map have been fetched, and all labeling is complete. This event will not
fire if the map never loads due to connectivity issues, or if the map is continuously changing
and never completes loading due to the user constantly interacting with the map.
When the camera is following my location because of GoogleMap.followMyLocation(int) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#followMyLocation(int)], this
callback will still be fired when the map has finished renerdering despite camera animating due
to following user's location.
