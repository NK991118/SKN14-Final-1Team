Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].
A matrix of routes computed for a set of origin/destination pairs by RouteMatrix.computeRouteMatrix [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/route-matrix#RouteMatrix.computeRouteMatrix]
Access by calling const {RouteMatrix} = await google.maps.importLibrary("routes"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].

| computeRouteMatrix | computeRouteMatrix(request) Parameters:  request:  ComputeRouteMatrixRequest Return Value:  Promise<{matrix:RouteMatrix}> Takes in a list of origins and destinations and returns a matrix containing route information for each combination of origin and destination.  Note: This method requires that you specify a response field mask in the request by setting the ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.fields property. The value is a list of field paths.  For example: Field mask of all available fields: fields: ['*'] Field mask of Route-level duration and distance: fields: ['durationMillis', 'distanceMeters']  Use of the wildcard response field mask fields: ['*'] is discouraged because: Selecting only the fields that you need helps our server save computation cycles, allowing us to return the result to you with a lower latency. Selecting only the fields that you need in your production job ensures stable latency performance. We might add more response fields in the future, and those new fields might require extra computation time. If you select all fields, or if you select all fields at the top level, then you might experience performance degradation because any new field we add will be automatically included in the response. Selecting only the fields that you need results in a smaller response size, and thus a faster load over the network. |

class

google.maps.routes.RouteMatrixItem
class

Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].
Contains route information computed for an origin/destination pair passed to RouteMatrix.computeRouteMatrix [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/route-matrix#RouteMatrix.computeRouteMatrix].

| Properties |
| --- |
| condition | Type:  RouteMatrixItemCondition optional Indicates whether the route was found or not. |
| distanceMeters | Type:  number optional The travel distance of the route in meters. |
| durationMillis | Type:  number optional The length of time needed to navigate the route in milliseconds. If you set ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.routingPreference to TRAFFIC_UNAWARE, then this value is the same as RouteMatrixItem.staticDurationMillis. If you set ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.routingPreference to either TRAFFIC_AWARE or TRAFFIC_AWARE_OPTIMAL, then this value is calculated taking traffic conditions into account.  Note: If the duration exceeds 2^53 milliseconds, then this value is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY. |
| error | Type:  RouteMatrixItemError optional Error that occurred during the computation of the route. |
| fallbackInfo | Type:  FallbackInfo optional In some cases when the server is not able to compute the route with the given preferences for this particular origin/destination pair, it may fall back to using a different mode of computation. When a fallback is used, this field contains detailed information about the fallback response. Otherwise this field is unset. |
| localizedValues | Type:  RouteMatrixItemLocalizedValues optional Text representations of properties of the RouteMatrixItem. |
| staticDurationMillis | Type:  number optional The duration of traveling through the route without taking traffic conditions into consideration.  Note: If the duration exceeds 2^53 milliseconds, then this value is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY. |

Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].
Request for a route matrix.
| Properties |
| --- |
| destinations | Type:  Iterable<string\|LatLng\|LatLngLiteral\|LatLngAltitudeLiteral\|DirectionalLocationLiteral\|Place\|Waypoint> Array of destinations, which determines the columns of the response matrix. A value passed as a string may be an address or plus code. Altitude values are not taken into consideration. |
| fields | Type:  Iterable<string> Collection of fields to be fetched. Specify ["*"] for all fields. |
| origins | Type:  Iterable<string\|LatLng\|LatLngLiteral\|LatLngAltitudeLiteral\|DirectionalLocationLiteral\|Place\|RouteMatrixOrigin\|Waypoint> Array of origins, which determines the rows of the response matrix. A value passed as a string may be an address or plus code. Altitude values are not taken into consideration.  Several size restrictions apply to the cardinality of origins and destinations: The total number of origins and destinations specified as strings or Places must be no greater than 50. The product of the number of origins and the number of destinations must be no greater than 625. The product of the number of origins and destinations must be no greater than 100 if ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.routingPreference is set to TRAFFIC_AWARE_OPTIMAL. The product of the number of origins and destinations must be no greater than 100 if ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.travelMode is set to TRANSIT. |
| arrivalTime optional | Type:  Date optional The arrival time.  Note: Can only be set when ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.travelMode is set to TRANSIT. You can specify either ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.departureTime or ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.arrivalTime, but not both. Transit trips are available for up to 7 days in the past or 100 days in the future. |
| departureTime optional | Type:  Date optional The departure time. If you don't set this value, then this value defaults to the time that you made the request.  Note: You can only specify a time in the past when ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.travelMode is set to TRANSIT. Transit trips are available for up to 7 days in the past or 100 days in the future. |
| extraComputations optional | Type:  Iterable<ComputeRouteMatrixExtraComputation> optional A list of extra computations which may be used to complete the request.  Note: These extra computations may return extra fields on the response. These extra fields must also be specified in ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.fields to be returned in the response. |
| language optional | Type:  string optional The BCP-47 language code, such as "en-US" or "sr-Latn". For more information, see Unicode Locale Identifier. See Language Support for the list of supported languages. When you don't provide this value, the language is inferred from your Google Maps JavaScript API localization settings. Otherwise, the language is inferred from the location of the first origin. |
| region optional | Type:  string optional The region code, specified as a ccTLD ("top-level domain") two-character value. For more information see Country code top-level domains. When you don't provide this value, the region is inferred from your Google Maps JavaScript API localization settings. Otherwise, the region is inferred from the location of the first origin. |
| routingPreference optional | Type:  RoutingPreference optional Specifies how to compute the route matrix. The server attempts to use the selected routing preference to compute the route matrix. If the routing preference results in an error or an extra long latency, an error is returned. You can specify this option only when ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.travelMode is DRIVING or TWO_WHEELER, otherwise the request fails. |
| trafficModel optional | Type:  TrafficModel optional Specifies the assumptions to use when calculating time in traffic. This setting affects the value returned in RouteMatrixItem.durationMillis which contains the predicted time in traffic based on historical averages. ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.trafficModel is only available for requests that have set ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.routingPreference to TRAFFIC_AWARE_OPTIMAL and ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.travelMode to DRIVING. Defaults to BEST_GUESS. |
| transitPreference optional | Type:  TransitPreference optional Specifies preferences that influence the route returned for TRANSIT routes.  Note: Can only be specified when ComputeRouteMatrixRequest.travelMode is set to TRANSIT. |
| travelMode optional | Type:  TravelMode optional Specifies the mode of transportation. |
| units optional | Type:  UnitSystem optional Specifies the units of measure for the display fields. If you don't provide this value, then the display units are inferred from the location of the first origin. |
