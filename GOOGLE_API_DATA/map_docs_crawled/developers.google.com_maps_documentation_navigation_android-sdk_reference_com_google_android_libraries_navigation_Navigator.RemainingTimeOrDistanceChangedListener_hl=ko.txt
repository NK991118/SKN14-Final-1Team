onRemainingTimeOrDistanceChanged
()

Called on the UI thread when the time or distance to the next destination has changed by more
than the thresholds specified in Navigator.addRemainingTimeOrDistanceChangedListener(int, int, Navigator.RemainingTimeOrDistanceChangedListener) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator#addRemainingTimeOrDistanceChangedListener(int,%20int,%20com.google.android.libraries.navigation.Navigator.RemainingTimeOrDistanceChangedListener)]. This
could be a result of (for example) user movement, a change in traffic conditions, a change in
route, a change in destination, or when the remaining time and distance first become known.
To get the remaining time and distance to the next destination, use Navigator.getCurrentTimeAndDistance() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator#getCurrentTimeAndDistance()]. To get the remaining time and distance to all
destinations, use Navigator.getTimeAndDistanceList() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator#getTimeAndDistanceList()].
