Public Methods

public
boolean

equals
(Object o)

Tests if this NavigationRoadStretchRenderingData [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationRoadStretchRenderingData] is equal to another.

public
int

getLengthMeters
()

Returns the length of the road stretch, in meters.

public
int

getOffsetMeters
()

Returns the offset of the road stretch relative to the start of the polyline (within which the
road stretch is defined), in meters.
In other words, the offset indicates how far into the polyline this particular road stretch
begins.

public
