GMSOverlay

@interface GMSOverlay : NSObject <NSCopying>

GMSOverlay is an abstract class that represents some overlay that may be attached to a specific
GMSMapView. It may not be instantiated directly; instead, instances of concrete overlay types
should be created directly (such as GMSMarker [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMarker.html], GMSPolyline [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPolyline.html], and GMSPolygon [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPolygon.html]).

This supports the NSCopying protocol; [overlay_ copy] will return a copy of the overlay type,
but with map set to nil.

title [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSOverlay#/c:objc(cs)GMSOverlay(py)title]

Title, a short description of the overlay. Some overlays, such as markers, will display the title
on the map. The title is also the default accessibility text.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, copy, nullable) NSString *title;

map [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSOverlay#/c:objc(cs)GMSOverlay(py)map]

The map this overlay is on. Setting this property will add the overlay to the map. Setting it to
nil removes this overlay from the map. An overlay may be active on at most one map at any given
time.

Declaration

Swift
weak var map: GMSMapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMapView.html]? { get set }

Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, weak, nullable) GMSMapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMapView.html] *map;

tappable [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSOverlay#/c:objc(cs)GMSOverlay(py)tappable]

If this overlay should cause tap notifications. Some overlays, such as markers, will default to
being tappable.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, getter=isTappable) BOOL tappable;

zIndex [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSOverlay#/c:objc(cs)GMSOverlay(py)zIndex]

Higher zIndex value overlays will be drawn on top of lower zIndex value tile layers and
overlays.  Equal values result in undefined draw ordering.  Markers are an exception that
regardless of zIndex, they will always be drawn above tile layers and other non-marker
overlays; they are effectively considered to be in a separate z-index group compared to other
overlays.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) int zIndex;

userData [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSOverlay#/c:objc(cs)GMSOverlay(py)userData]

Overlay data. You can use this property to associate an arbitrary object with this overlay.
Google Maps SDK for iOS neither reads nor writes this property.

Note that userData should not hold any strong references to any Maps objects, otherwise a retain
cycle may be created (preventing objects from being released).

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, nullable) id userData;
