This interface is used by ForegroundServiceManager [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/ForegroundServiceManager] to provide the notification content
when a persistent notification is shared. Clients should extend NotificationContentProviderBase [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NotificationContentProviderBase] if they wish to control the content of the persistent
notification. The notification can also support its own click handling and intent firing.
