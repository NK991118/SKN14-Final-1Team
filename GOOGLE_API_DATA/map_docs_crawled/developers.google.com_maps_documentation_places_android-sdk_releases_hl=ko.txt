Place.Field.DINE_IN
Place.Field.CURBSIDE_PICKUP

Added new Place.BooleanPlaceAttributeValue [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/api/model/Place.BooleanPlaceAttributeValue] class that defines the values of these new place attribute fields.
November 01, 2022
2.7.0

Release 2.7.0

The Places SDK for Android version 2.7.0 is now available. For information about this release, and for all previous releases, see the Release Notes [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/release-notes] or subscribe to the Release Notes XML feed [https://developers.google.com/static/feeds/places-sdk-android-release-notes.xml].

If you are a new user, see Set Up in the Google Cloud Console [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/cloud-setup] to start the installation process.

If you are an existing customer, see the upgrade instructions at Versions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/versions].
2.7.0

To provide expanded support for filtering Place Autocomplete by multiple place types,  the following are deprecated as of v2.7.0:

AutocompleteSupportFragment.setTypeFilter(TypeFilter typeFilter) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/widget/AutocompleteSupportFragment#public-autocompletesupportfragment-settypefilter-typefilter-typefilter]
FindAutocompletePredictionsRequest.Builder.setTypeFilter(TypeFilter typeFilter) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/api/net/FindAutocompletePredictionsRequest.Builder#setTypeFilter(com.google.android.libraries.places.api.model.TypeFilter)]
Autocomplete.IntentBuilder.setTypeFilter(TypeFilter typeFilter) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/widget/Autocomplete.IntentBuilder#setTypeFilter(com.google.android.libraries.places.api.model.TypeFilter)]

Instead, use:

AutocompleteSupportFragment.setTypesFilter(List<String> placeTypes) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/widget/AutocompleteSupportFragment#setTypesFilter(java.util.List%3Cjava.lang.String%3E)]
FindAutocompletePredictionsRequest.Builder.setTypesFilter(List<String> placeTypes) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/api/net/FindAutocompletePredictionsRequest.Builder#setTypesFilter(java.util.List%3Cjava.lang.String%3E)]
Autocomplete.IntentBuilder.setTypesFilter(List<String> placeTypes) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/widget/Autocomplete.IntentBuilder#setTypesFilter(java.util.List%3Cjava.lang.String%3E)]

The minimum version of the Places SDK for Android with setTypesFilter(List<String> placeTypes) is v2.7.0.
2.7.0

Added the setTypesFilter(List<String> placeTypes) method to AutocompleteSupportFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/widget/AutocompleteSupportFragment],  FindAutocompletePredictionsRequest.Builder [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/api/net/FindAutocompletePredictionsRequest.Builder], and Autocomplete.IntentBuilder [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/widget/Autocomplete.IntentBuilder]. Use this method to specify up to five values to restrict results from a Place Autocomplete request.

For more information, see Filter results by place type or type collection [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/autocomplete#filter_results_by_place_types_or_type_collection].
2.7.0

If your app does not use PlacesClient.findCurrentPlace(), you must now explicitly remove both the
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION and ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permissions. In previous releases, you only had to remove ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.

For more information, see Current Place [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/current-place].
2.7.0

122841340:  When you call Places.initialize(Context, String, Locale) and the specified Locale is different from the device's locale, the autocomplete widget now localizes both the search hint and the search results based on the setting of Locale. If you omit Locale, then it uses the device's locale.

March 31, 2022 - v2.6.0

Features

The Place.isOpen() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/place-details#is-open]
method now considers the value of
Place.Field.BUSINESS_STATUS [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/api/model/Place.BusinessStatus]
and Place.Field.UTC_OFFSET [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/api/model/Place.Field#public-static-final-place.field-utc_offset]
to compute its return value.

To ensure accurate results from the Place.isOpen() method, request the
Place.Field.BUSINESS_STATUS field and the Place.Field.UTC_OFFSET
field in your original place request.
If  the returned Place object contains Place.Field.BUSINESS_STATUS with a
value of CLOSED_PERMANENTLY or CLOSED_TEMPORARILY, Places.isOpen() returns
false. If Place.Field.BUSINESS_STATUS was not requested or is unavailable,
Places.isOpen() assumes that the business is operational.

Deprecation

Places SDK for Android Version 2.6.0 is the last version that supports
the equivalent Places SDK for Android compatibility library.
If you are using the compatibility library to access Places SDK for Android
features or data, we recommend that you follow the
migration guide [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/client-migration]
to use the Places SDK for Android directly before the release of
Places SDK for Android Version 2.7.0. The compatibility library
will not be supported above Version 2.6.0.

October 18, 2021 - Freezing support for API Level 23, 24 and 25

In response to changes in our internal dependencies, Android API Level 23,
24, and 25 (Android 6, 7.0 and 7.1) will not be supported in new versions of the
Places SDK for Android beginning in the third quarter of 2022.

Places SDK for Android versions released beginning in the third
quarter of 2022 will only support devices running a minimum of
Android API Level 26.

App versions built with v2.x or lower of the Places SDK for Android
will continue to work on devices running Android API Level 25 and below.

Be sure to specify a version [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/versions]
in your application's build dependencies in order to control when you raise
the minimum supported OS for new versions of your app.

October 14, 2021 - v2.5.0

Features

Added new Place fields [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/place-details#place-details]
(iconBackgroundColor and iconURL) to allow for rendering icons that
indicate the place (POI) type.

Improvements

Added @RecentlyNonNull and @RecentlyNullable annotations. This change
will cause warnings on null safety violations, and provides better Kotlin
interoperability and better static null checking for apps that use Java null
checking frameworks.
Autocomplete widgets now have debouncing when typing quickly.
Volley dependency updated to 1.2.1 in observation of the sunset of JCenter [https://developer.android.com/studio/build/jcenter-migration].

Bug fixes

Fixed a bug where the Autocomplete widget was resetting the text query in
some cases.

September 16, 2020 - v2.4.0

API changes

Added getters to request builders and model builders, for better Kotlin
interoperability.

Bug Fixes

Fixes an issue where the autocomplete search box would unexpectedly clear.

May 26, 2020 - v2.3.0

New Features

Added BusinessStatus [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/api/model/Place.Field]
field and mask for FetchPlace [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/api/net/PlacesClient#fetchPlace(com.google.android.libraries.places.api.net.FetchPlaceRequest)]
and FindCurrentPlace [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/places/api/net/PlacesClient#findCurrentPlace(com.google.android.libraries.places.api.net.FindCurrentPlaceRequest)].

April 21, 2020 - Plus code support in Place Autocomplete

Place Autocomplete now supports plus codes [https://plus.codes/]. This change
is supported for all versions.

February 3, 2020 - v.2.2.0

New Features

Place Autocomplete response now returns the distance in meters from each
supported prediction, based on the specified origin (LatLng) in programmatic
predictions requests [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/autocomplete#get_place_predictions_programmatically]. See the blog
post [https://mapsplatform.google.com/resources/blog/new-autocomplete-features-in-google-maps-platform-help-your-users-make-faster-decisions] to learn
more about this enhancement.
Place Autocomplete now supports filtering by multiple countries [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/autocomplete#filter_results_by_country]
(up to five).

November 4, 2019 - v.2.1.0

New Features

Added ability to create AutocompleteSupportFragment programmatically with a
static newInstance method.

AutocompleteSupportFragment.newInstance returns a new autocomplete
fragment with default config.

AutocompleteSupportFragment setters now return the instance so the setters
can be chained in a builder-like fashion.

Resolved Issues

Resolved issue where empty AddressComponent types incorrectly threw
IllegalStateException. Some address components legitimately have no types.
Resolved issue where the autocomplete widget would lose its state on
configuration change, for example, from portrait to landscape layout.
Resolved issue where findCurrentPlace may crash when there are too many access
points nearby.

Known Issues

Our dependency on FragmentFactory is implemented by AndroidX, but our
javadocs believe it is implemented by the Support Libraries.

July 17, 2019 - v.2.0.0

Incompatible Changes

Changed from support library to AndroidX [https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx].
For details, see the migration guide [https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate].

Features

Adds two new methods to Place:

Place.getUtcOffsetMinutes() returns the UTC offset for a place, in
minutes.
Place.isOpen() and Place.isOpen(long utcTimeMillis) return a boolean
indicating whether the place is currently open.

Added Autcomplete.IntentBuilder.setHint(String hint) to allow changing the
hint text for the search box.

Improvements

Autocomplete API behavior has changed: All leading whitespace will be
removed, and trailing whitespace will be replaced with a single space. This
helps to conserve on network requests by using previously cached responses when
user types in extra whitespace (e.g “Google     ”).
Dependency on Glide has been removed, resulting in a smaller APK size.

April 1, 2019 - v.1.1.0

API changes

minSDKVersion is increased from 14 to 16.

New Features

Added support for AddressComponents to the Place object (with the exception
of findCurrentPlace()).

Improvements

Improved model class validation (e.g OpeningHours.getWeekdayText() may not
contain empty or null values).
Removed Maven dependency on Guava resulting in reduced app size.

Resolved issues

Resolved proguard issue that caused OpeningHours.Builder and
AutocompletePrediction.builder.setPlaceTypes() to be stripped from the AAR,
and Place.Builder.autoBuild() to not be stripped from the AAR.
The AutocompleteActivity editText has been updated to manually request focus
(required on API level 28).
Made all collections in models classes immutable.
Added support for restoring AutocompleteActivity state on config changes.

January 29, 2019 - v.1.0

Features

The Places SDK for Android is now distributed via a standalone static
library, to enable more frequent updates and quicker bug fixes.
Added a compatibility library to help with migration from the previous
Android library, to the new and improved library.
Added the ability to programmatically set/replace API keys.
Added support for cancelling requests.
Added support for using fields to enable specifying the types of place data
to return.
The Place object can now return the total number of reviews for each place.
The Place object now returns business opening hours.
Added support for Plus codes [https://plus.codes/]. Plus codes are short
codes that provide an address for every location in the world, even in
areas where traditional street addresses don't exist.
Place autocomplete now supports session-based billing.

June 14, 2018

Enabled the new basemap style for the Place Picker. This applies to all
versions of the Places SDK for Android. See the
blog post [https://maps-apis.googleblog.com/2018/02/updated-basemap-style-for-google-maps.html]
for more information about the new style.

September 2016 - v.9.6

Added the
setCountry [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/places/AutocompleteFilter.Builder#setCountry(java.lang.String)]
method to restrict the scope of a Places autocomplete request to a single
country.
Bug fixes and improvements to the Place Picker and Autocomplete Widget.

August 2016 - v.9.4

The Places API now includes a redesigned
Place Picker UI [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/placepicker] that implements the
principles of material design.

December 17, 2015

This release adds the autocomplete widget [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/autocomplete],
a search dialog with built-in autocomplete functionality. As a user enters
search terms, the widget presents a list of predicted places to choose from.
Autocomplete functionality has also been added to the place picker [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/placepicker].

September 24, 2015

This release adds three new methods to
AutocompletePrediction [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/places/AutocompletePrediction],
giving you easy access to the primary and secondary parts of the place
description as well as the full text of the description. This is useful, for
example, when you want to display a short title followed by further detail
about the place. See the
sample code on GitHub [https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-places/tree/master/].
The new methods are as follows:

getFullText(CharacterStyle matchStyle)
returns the full text of a place description. This is a
combination of the primary and secondary text. Example:
"Eiffel Tower, Avenue Anatole France, Paris, France".
This method is equivalent to the existing getDescription() method. In
addition, it lets you highlight the sections of the description that match
the search with a style of your choice, using
CharacterStyle [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/style/CharacterStyle.html].
The CharacterStyle parameter is optional. Set it to null if  you don't
need any highlighting.
getPrimaryText(CharacterStyle matchStyle)
returns the main text describing a place. This is usually
the name of the place. Examples: "Eiffel Tower", and
"123 Pitt Street".
getSecondaryText(CharacterStyle matchStyle) returns the subsidiary text
of a place description.
This is useful, for example, as a second line when showing autocomplete
predictions. Examples: "Avenue Anatole France, Paris, France", and
"Sydney, New South Wales".

Accompanying the above improvement, the following methods on
AutocompletePrediction [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/places/AutocompletePrediction],
are now deprecated:

getDescription() is now deprecated. Please use getFullText(),
getPrimaryText(), and/or getSecondaryText() to retrieve the full or
partial description,
getMatchedSubstrings() is now deprecated.  Please use getFullText()
to format matches more easily.

The upcoming release of Android (Android M) introduces a new model for
handling permissions, which streamlines the process for users when they
install and upgrade apps. Provided you're using version 8.1 or later of
Google Play services, you can configure your app to target the Android M SDK
and use the new permissions model. To learn more, see
Working
with System Permissions [https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/index.html].

August 13, 2015

Added support for retrieving and displaying Place Photos [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/photos].

April 28, 2015

Added a getAttributions() method on
PlaceBuffer [https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/places/PlaceBuffer.html].
You now need to display third-party attributions if your app uses a
PlaceBuffer by calling
get place by ID [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/place-details#get-place]. See the
attributions guide [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/attributions] for details.

March 2015

This is the first release of the Places SDK for Android,
included as part of the Google Play services SDK.
