include
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] point)

Includes this point for building of the bounds. The bounds will be extended in a minimum way
to include this point.
More precisely, it will consider extending the bounds both in the eastward and westward
directions (one of which may cross the antimeridian) and choose the smaller of the two. In
the case that both directions result in a LatLngBounds of the same size, this will extend it
in the eastward direction. For example, adding points (0, -179) and (1, 179) will create a
bound crossing the 180 longitude.

Parameters
| point | A LatLng to be included in the bounds. |
| --- | --- |

Returns
This builder object with a new point added.
