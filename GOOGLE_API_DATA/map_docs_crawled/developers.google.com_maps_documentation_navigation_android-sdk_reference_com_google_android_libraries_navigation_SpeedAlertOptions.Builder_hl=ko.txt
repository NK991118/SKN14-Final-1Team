SpeedAlertOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertOptions]

build
()

Builds a SpeedAlertOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertOptions].
Setting the same percentage threshold for SpeedAlertSeverity.MINOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MINOR] and SpeedAlertSeverity.MAJOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MAJOR] speed alerts disables the SpeedAlertSeverity.MINOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MINOR] speed
alert and will only allow SpeedAlertSeverity.MAJOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MAJOR] speed alert.

Throws
| IllegalArgumentException | if not all of the following conditions are satisfied: You have set SpeedAlertSeverity.MINOR speed alert triggering threshold as a percentage with a non-negative float value You have set SpeedAlertSeverity.MAJOR speed alert triggering threshold as a percentage with a non-negative float value that is at least the SpeedAlertSeverity.MINOR speed alert threshold percentage You have set SpeedAlertSeverity.MAJOR speed alert triggering threshold in seconds with a positive double value |

setSeverityUpgradeDurationSeconds
(double seconds)

Sets the time in seconds needed to upgrade speed alerts from SpeedAlertSeverity.MINOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MINOR]
to SpeedAlertSeverity.MAJOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MAJOR].
Speeding over SpeedAlertSeverity.MINOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MINOR] percentage threshold for longer than
specified seconds triggers SpeedAlertSeverity.MAJOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MAJOR] speed alert.

setSpeedAlertThresholdPercentage
(SpeedAlertSeverity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity] speedAlertSeverity, float percentageAboveLimit)

Sets the triggering threshold as a percentage for the speed alert of the specified SpeedAlertSeverity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity].
You need this method to customize the speed alert triggering thresholds as a percentage
for both SpeedAlertSeverity.MINOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MINOR] and SpeedAlertSeverity.MAJOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MAJOR] alerts.
