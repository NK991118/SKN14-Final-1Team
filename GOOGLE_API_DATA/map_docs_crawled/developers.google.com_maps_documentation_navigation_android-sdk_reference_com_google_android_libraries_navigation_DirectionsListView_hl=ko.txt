public     class
DirectionsListView
extends RelativeLayout

A View which displays a list of directions for navigation.
Users of this class must forward all the life cycle methods from the Activity [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html] or Fragment [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html] containing this view to the corresponding
ones in this class. In particular, you must forward on the following methods:

onCreate(Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)]
onStart() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onStart()]
onResume() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onResume()]
onPause() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onPause()]
onStop() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onStop()]
onDestroy() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onDestroy()]
onConfigurationChanged(Configuration) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onConfigurationChanged(android.content.res.Configuration)]
onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle)]

If the DirectionsListView is added after its parent Activity [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html] or Fragment [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html] has been through its creation lifecycle, you must call onCreate(Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)],
onStart() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onStart()] and onResume() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onResume()] manually to properly initialize it. Similarly, if a
DirectionsListView is detached from its parent Activity [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html] or Fragment [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html], you must manually call onPause() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onPause()], onStop() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onStop()] and onDestroy() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/DirectionsListView#onDestroy()] to prevent leaks.
