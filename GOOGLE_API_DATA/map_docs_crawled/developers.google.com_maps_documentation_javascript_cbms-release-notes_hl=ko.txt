August 04, 2025
Fixed improper interpolation behavior that occurred in some cases when keyzooms
were set for multiple colors within the same feature.
July 15, 2025
Added opacity controls for most styleable features. This can also be used to
control the visibility of feature elements that don't support visibility
controls.
Updated the Map feature hierarchy (JS [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-customization/taxonomy#hier], Android [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/cloud-customization/taxonomy#hier], iOS [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/cloud-customization/taxonomy#hier]) as follows:

Added Commercial and Commuter under Infrastructure > Railway Track.
Changed the Natural > Land cover > Vegetation node to Natural > Land > Land cover.

March 31, 2025
Added ability to create and customize map styles using dark mode.
Added ability to associate a dark mode map style to a map ID.
Added ability to preview light and dark mode styles for a single map ID on the map preview page.
Removed ability to associate multiple map IDs with a map style on the style details page to prevent the removal of other map ID or map style associations without warning.
March 17, 2025
Added JSON import tab option to style creation. Learn more [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-customization/map-styles-leg#json-import].
March 03, 2025
More reminders of the pending style migrations have been added to pages and components within the Google Cloud console that reference map styles; users will begin seeing these reminders on March 4, 2025, and legacy map styles will be unavailable starting March 25, 2025.
Polyline stroke width for new vector styles now has parity with raster styles.
February 27, 2025
Added a preview mode in the style editor to enable the new road level details feature. Learn more [https://developers.google.com/maps/comms/msa-road-level-details] about road level details on Maps SDKs.

Added ability to customize road level details in the style editor. Learn more [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-customization/zoom-levels-leg#road-detail-preview] about custom styling for road level details.
December 17, 2024
Added a new interactive dialog for creating new styles, which includes an option to use a monochromatic map template.
Style editor displays empty dots next to features with children that have edited styles, or filled dots if the feature has edited styles.
The keyzooms panel has a "reset" button that removes custom styles across all zoom levels. This is the same functionality as the "remove" button in the main panel.
The style details and map details pages have an interactive preview of the map style and an easier to read details section.
When associating a style to a map ID from the map details page, you can now see preview thumbnails for your styles.
The style editor now uses SDK style tables, which are the new Maps JavaScript API standard for vector maps [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/vector-map]. They are significantly more compact in size than the previous style tables and are more performant.  The latency of redrawing after a style change should improve.
Added various accessibility improvements throughout the style editor, including screen reader experience, keyboard navigation, contrast, and screen magnification compatibility.
Improved the positioning of the keyzooms panel to no longer cover other elements.
Added a new look and feel for map style cards that are responsive and dark-mode friendly.

September 26, 2024
Updated the map style editor as follows:

When style customization values are unset, you can now see the original basemap stroke width and visibility values (read more [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-customization/zoom-levels-leg#overwrite_the_default_basemap_color_values_for_an_element]).

Refreshed the look and feel of the user interface in Google Cloud Console.

Added new nodes for Paved and Unpaved trails under Infrastructure > Road network > No traffic > Trail.
Points of interest > Transit > Airport now covers both the point of interest and the area of interest.

Newly created map styles more closely match default SDK maps for Android, iOS, and JavaScript.

Buildings will now be displayed as footprint outlines rather than as 3D meshes.
Landmark POIs will now be displayed as illustrated icons rather than POI pins.

September 16, 2024
You can now customize the app background color [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-customization/app-background-leg.md] across platforms from the style editor. This is the color displayed when tiles are loading as you pan or zoom.
August 27, 2024
Cloud-based maps styling now features modernized pins. The latest map styles will use the new pins, which are modern, rounded pin shapes with more vibrant pin colors that are harmonized with the new map colors.

The old pins will continue to be used on legacy map styles.
July 31, 2024

Legacy cloud-based maps styling deprecation

All legacy map styles will need to be migrated to the next-generation of
cloud-based maps styling [https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/next-generation-of-cloud-based-maps-styling-now-generally-available-with-new-zoom-level-customization-and-usability-improvements]
to bring more customization capabilities for developers.

All Google cloud projects with existing legacy map styles or those who have
chosen to opt-out of the next generation of cloud-based map styling prior to
March 18, 2024, will be able to retain those preferences until March 25, 2025.

Starting March 18, 2024, you will not be able to create new legacy map
styles unless you have previously opted-out of the latest version of
cloud-based maps styling.

After March 25, 2025, all legacy map styles will be automatically migrated
and decommissioned. This automatic migration might result in some changes to the
map styles.

Update any legacy map
styles [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/cloud-customization/update-legacy] to the latest
version before March 25, 2025 to avoid any disruption in some of your map
styles.

Known issues

Following are known issues with cloud-based maps styling.

Text stroke styling doesn't always work if it is not styled in the base map.
The known case is for Water.
312220318 [https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/312220318]: When
strokes are applied to 3D buildings, the stroke is ignored, and different
shades of the fill color are used instead to create effective edges.
332916114 [https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/332916114]: Not all
Map features are style-able.

iOS Known Issues

The iOS client does not interpolate text stroke color for labels.
