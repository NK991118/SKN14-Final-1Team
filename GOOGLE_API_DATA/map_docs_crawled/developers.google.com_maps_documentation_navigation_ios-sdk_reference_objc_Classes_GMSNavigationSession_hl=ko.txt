GMSNavigationSession

@interface GMSNavigationSession : NSObject

This class provides a set of related objects that can be used to programmatically control
a navigation session.

started [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationSession#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationSession(py)started]

Whether or not navigation on this session is started.

A session cannot be started unless terms and conditions have previously
been accepted.

Starting a session is a prerequisite for activating guidance on the
session’s navigator, or for starting location updates from the session’s
road-snapped location provider.

A started session receives location from CoreLocation as determined
by the application’s location authorization. Your app can temporarily stop the Navigation SDK
from requesting location updates. For instance, it might do this in order to reduce battery usage
in a period when location updates are known to be unnecessary.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, getter=isStarted) BOOL started;

travelMode [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationSession#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationSession(py)travelMode]

The travel mode for this session.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) GMSNavigationTravelMode [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationTravelMode.html] travelMode;

locationSimulator [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationSession#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationSession(py)locationSimulator]

An instance of GMSLocationSimulator [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSLocationSimulator.html] which can be used to simulate locations for this session,
or nil if terms and conditions have not been accepted.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly, nullable) GMSLocationSimulator [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSLocationSimulator.html] *locationSimulator;

have not been accepted.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly, nullable) GMSNavigator [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigator.html] *navigator;

roadSnappedLocationProvider [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationSession#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationSession(py)roadSnappedLocationProvider]

The road-snapped location provider for this session, or nil if terms and conditions have not
been accepted.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly, nullable) GMSRoadSnappedLocationProvider [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSRoadSnappedLocationProvider.html] *roadSnappedLocationProvider;

-init [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationSession#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationSession(im)init]
