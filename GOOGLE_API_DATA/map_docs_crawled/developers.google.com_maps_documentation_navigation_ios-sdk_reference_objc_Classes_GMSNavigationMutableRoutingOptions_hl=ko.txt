GMSNavigationMutableRoutingOptions

@interface GMSNavigationMutableRoutingOptions : GMSNavigationRoutingOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationRoutingOptions.html]

A mutable class that contains options related to routing logic (e.g., routing strategy).

routingStrategy [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationMutableRoutingOptions#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationMutableRoutingOptions(py)routingStrategy]

Specifies the ranking order of routes, either by time, or by distance.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) GMSNavigationRoutingStrategy [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationRoutingStrategy.html] routingStrategy;

alternateRoutesStrategy [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationMutableRoutingOptions#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationMutableRoutingOptions(py)alternateRoutesStrategy]

The alternate routes strategy used when setting destinations.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) GMSNavigationAlternateRoutesStrategy [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationAlternateRoutesStrategy.html] alternateRoutesStrategy;

targetDistancesMeters [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationMutableRoutingOptions#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationMutableRoutingOptions(py)targetDistancesMeters]

Target distances used to ranking the routes. The elements should be non-negative
integers.
Donâ€™t set GMSNavigationAlternateRoutesStrategy [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationAlternateRoutesStrategy.html] and this field at the same time.
Target distance is only supported for the first destination for now. So only put one
positive integer in the array. If the first element is not a positive integer, the
routing strategy defaults to the best routing strategy.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, copy, nullable) NSArray<NSNumber *> *targetDistancesMeters;
