public
Waypoint [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Waypoint]

build
()

Creates and returns a new instance of Waypoint using the attributes from the Builder object.

Returns
a new Waypoint instance.

Throws
| IllegalStateException | if neither a lat/lng position nor a placeIdString have been set. |
| --- | --- |

public
Waypoint.Builder [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Waypoint.Builder]

setLatLng
(double latitude, double longitude)

Sets a latitude/longitude pair to create the LatLng position used to build new Waypoint
instances. It cannot be used together with a placeIdString.

Parameters
| latitude | the latitude at which to place the waypoint. This will be clamped to between -90 degrees and +90 degrees inclusive. |
| --- | --- |
| longitude | the longitude at which to place the waypoint. This will be normalized to be within -180 degrees inclusive and +180 degrees exclusive. |

Returns
the object upon which the method was called, with the updated lat/lng position.

Throws
| IllegalArgumentException | if a placeIdString has already been set. |
| --- | --- |

setPlaceIdString
(String placeIdString)

Sets the ID of a place used to build new Waypoint instances. It cannot be used together with
a lat/lng position.

Parameters
| placeIdString | the ID of the place. |
| --- | --- |

Returns
the object upon which the method was called, with the updated placeIdString.

Throws
| IllegalArgumentException | if a lat/lng position has already been set. |
| --- | --- |
| Waypoint.UnsupportedPlaceIdException | if given an unsupported place ID. |

setPreferSameSideOfRoad
(boolean preferSameSideOfRoad)

Sets whether it is preferred to route the driver to the same side of the road. The route will
arrive on the preferred side of the road unless there is a significant delay caused by a road
closure or slow-moving traffic.
If setPreferredHeading(int) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Waypoint.Builder#setPreferredHeading(int)] is called after this function, the value set here will not
have any effect.
If this function is called after setPreferredHeading(int) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Waypoint.Builder#setPreferredHeading(int)], then it will reset the
preferredHeading.

Parameters
| preferSameSideOfRoad | the new value for the side of the road preference. |
| --- | --- |

Returns
the object upon which the method was called, with the updated preferSameSideOfRoad.

public
Waypoint.Builder [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Waypoint.Builder]

setPreferredHeading
(int preferredHeading)

Sets an angle used to express the direction of traffic on the side of the road that the
vehicle should arrive on. Consequently, it is not useful for one-way streets.
If setPreferSameSideOfRoad(boolean) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Waypoint.Builder#setPreferSameSideOfRoad(boolean)] is called after this function, then the
preferredHeading will be resetted.
If this function is called after setPreferSameSideOfRoad(boolean) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Waypoint.Builder#setPreferSameSideOfRoad(boolean)], then the
preferSameSideOfRoad value set using that function will be ignored.

Parameters
| preferredHeading | the new preferred segment heading angle in degrees [0, 360], where 0 means North. |
| --- | --- |

Returns
the object upon which the method was called, with the updated preferredHeading.

Throws
| Waypoint.InvalidSegmentHeadingException | if given an invalid segment heading. |
| --- | --- |

setVehicleStopover
(boolean vehicleStopover)

Enables the automatic relocation of the waypoint to a nearby place if its location is not
suitable for a vehicle to make a stop. Elevated areas, ferries, underground locations and
areas of limited access will be relocated to a nearby safe location.
Note: In certain cases, particularly in metro areas, waypoints cannot be set within
tunnels, even if vehicleStopover is set to false.

Parameters
| vehicleStopover | the new value for the vehicleStopover preference. |
| --- | --- |

Returns
the object upon which the method was called, with the updated vehicleStopover.
