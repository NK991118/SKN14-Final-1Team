public     class
StreetViewPanoramaView
extends FrameLayout

A View which displays a Street View panorama (with data obtained from the Google Maps service).
When focused, it captures keypresses and touch gestures to move the panorama.
Users of this class must forward all the life cycle methods from the Activity [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html] or
Fragment [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html] containing this view to the corresponding ones in this class. In
particular, you must forward the following methods:

onCreate(Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaView#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)]
onStart() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaView#onStart()]
onResume() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaView#onResume()]
onPause() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaView#onPause()]
onStop() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaView#onStop()]
onDestroy() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaView#onDestroy()]
onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaView#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle)]
onLowMemory() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaView#onLowMemory()]

A StreetViewPanorama [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanorama] must be acquired using getStreetViewPanoramaAsync(OnStreetViewPanoramaReadyCallback) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaView#getStreetViewPanoramaAsync(com.google.android.gms.maps.OnStreetViewPanoramaReadyCallback)]. The StreetViewPanoramaView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaView] automatically initializes the Street View system and the view.
For a simpler method of displaying a StreetViewPanorama use StreetViewPanoramaFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaFragment]
(or SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment]) if you are looking to target earlier platforms.
Note: You are advised not to add children to this view.
Note: The Google Maps SDK for Android does not support multiple StreetViewPanoramaView
objects in one activity.
