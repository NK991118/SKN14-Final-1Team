Structures
The following structures are available globally.

GMSMapPoint [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSMapPoint]

A point on the map. May represent a projected coordinate.

x is in [-1, 1]. The axis direction is normal: y grows towards North, x grows towards East. (0,
0) is the center of the map.

See GMSProject() and GMSUnproject().

Declaration

Swift
struct GMSMapPoint

Objective-C
struct GMSMapPoint {}

GMSOrientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSOrientation]

GMSOrientation is a tuple of heading and pitch used to control the viewing
direction of a GMSPanoramaCamera [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaCamera].

Declaration

Swift
struct GMSOrientation

Objective-C
struct {}

GMSVisibleRegion [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSVisibleRegion]

GMSVisibleRegion contains the four points defining the polygon that is visible in a mapâ€™s
camera.

This polygon can be a trapezoid instead of a rectangle, because a camera can have tilt. If the
camera is directly over the center of the camera, the shape is rectangular, but if the camera is
tilted, the shape will appear to be a trapezoid whose smallest side is closest to the point of
view.

Declaration

Swift
struct GMSVisibleRegion

Objective-C
struct {}
