LatLngBounds
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] southwest, LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] northeast)

Creates a new bounds based on a southwest and a northeast corner.
The bounds conceptually includes all points where:

the latitude is in the range [northeast.latitude, southwest.latitude];
the longitude is in the range [southwest.longitude, northeast.longitude] if
southwest.longitude ≤ northeast.longitude; and
the longitude is in the range [southwest.longitude, 180) ∪ [-180,
northeast.longitude] if southwest.longitude > northeast.longitude.

Parameters
| southwest | southwest corner |
| --- | --- |
| northeast | northeast corner |

Throws
| IllegalArgumentException | if the latitude of the northeast corner is below the latitude of the southwest corner. |

LatLngBounds
(LatLngBounds [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLngBounds] bounds)

Copy constructor.

Parameters
| bounds | the object to copy. |

Public Methods

public
static
LatLngBounds.Builder [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLngBounds.Builder]

builder
()

Creates a new builder.

public
boolean

contains
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] point)

Returns whether this contains the given LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng].

Parameters
| point | the LatLng to test |
| --- | --- |

Returns
true if this contains the given point; false if not.

createFromAttributes
(Context context, AttributeSet attrs)

Creates a LatLngBounds from the AttributeSet [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/AttributeSet.html].

Parameters
| context |  |
| --- | --- |
| attrs |  |

public
boolean

equals
(Object o)

Parameters
| o |  |
| --- | --- |

public
LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng]

getCenter
()

Returns the center of this LatLngBounds. The center is simply the average of the coordinates
(taking into account if it crosses the antimeridian). This is approximately the geographical
center (it would be exact if the Earth were a perfect sphere). It will not necessarily be the
center of the rectangle as drawn on the map due to the Mercator projection.

Returns
A LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] that is the center of the LatLngBounds.

including
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] point)

Returns a new LatLngBounds [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLngBounds] that extends this LatLngBounds to include the given LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng]. This will return the smallest LatLngBounds that contains both this and the extra
point.
In particular, it will consider extending the bounds both in the eastward and westward
directions (one of which may cross the antimeridian) and choose the smaller of the two. In the
case that both directions result in a LatLngBounds of the same size, this will extend it in the
eastward direction.

Parameters
| point | a LatLng to be included in the new bounds |
| --- | --- |

Returns
A new LatLngBounds [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLngBounds] that contains this and the extra point.
