Versions of Maps and Places SDKs for iOS that release beginning the second quarter
of 2023 will support a minimum of iOS 14. Earlier SDK versions will continue
supporting iOS 13.

If your dependencies do not specify a version number, your IDE will load the
newest SDK version and new builds of your app will not support iOS 13.

Be sure to specify a version [https://developers.google.com//maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/versions]
in your application's build dependencies in order to control when you raise the
minimum supported OS for new versions of your app.

Version 3.6.0 - October 29, 2019

Note:

Added local caching for UIImages fetched using loadPlacePhoto:callback
such that calling the method twice in a row returns the same UIImage.

Version 3.5.0 - October 08, 2019

Note:

<GooglePlaces/GooglePlaces.h> no longer transitively includes classes from
GoogleMapsBase.h, so if you use the GMSCoordinateBounds class in your code,
you must now #import <GoogleMapsBase/GoogleMapsBase.h> as well.

Version 3.4.0 - September 04, 2019

Version bump, no changes. This version is functionally identical to v.3.3.0.

Version 3.3.0 - July 29, 2019

and opt-out API options (see below) are no longer supported. This applies to
all versions of the Places SDK for iOS. See the
blog post [https://maps-apis.googleblog.com/2018/02/updated-basemap-style-for-google-maps.html]
for more information about the new style.

Place Picker New Style Default - June 28, 2018

Features:

Enabled the new basemap style for the Place Picker by default. You can still
opt-out temporarily if you need time to modify your app to accommodate the
new style. If you do, please follow Issue 72853629 [https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/72853629] which contains the
timeline for end of support of the previous basemap style. We will be
posting updates there as they are available.

To opt-out, use the code snippet
below. The best place to do this in your app is right after providing your
API key, via GMSServices provideAPIKey. You must be using at least
Version 2.6.0 in order to opt-out. If you had previously opted-in to the new
basemap style, this should replace the code you added to opt-in. See the
blog post [https://maps-apis.googleblog.com/2018/02/updated-basemap-style-for-google-maps.html]
for more information about the new style.
NSArray *options = @[@"B3H9HE845CFHYG"];

for more information about the new style.
NSArray *options = @[@"B3MWHUG2MR0DQW"];
BOOL didSetApiOptions = [GMSServices provideAPIOptions:options];
NSLog(@“Options were set: %d”, didSetApiOptions);

Version 2.6.0 - February 2018

Improvements:

Updated the Place Picker default marker to match the new Google Maps
marker.

Note:
- Updated for compatibility with GoogleMaps/GooglePlacePicker 2.6.0
Version 2.5.0 - October 2017

date.Note:
- The armv7s architecture in the frameworks has been removed. Devices which
previously used armv7s are still supported using the armv7 architecture.
All applications using the default architecture settings in any supported
version of Xcode should not notice any change.Note:
- The layout of the static frameworks has changed. There is no longer a
Versions directory. The contents of Versions/A has been moved to the root
directory of the framework. Developers who manually integrate frameworks
with their project should take additional care during the upgrade.Note:
- Support for Xcode 7.3 will be dropped with 2.5.0.
Version 2.3.1 - June 19, 2017

Resolved Issues

Fixed an issue resulting in a crash when receiving photos for certain
places. (Issue 36575500 [https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36575500].)

Version 2.3 - May 30, 2017

Features

Expanded the number of scenarios where you can use the place picker with the
addition of GMSPlacePickerViewController. The old GMSPlacePicker is now
deprecated.

Improvements

Dropped support for iOS 7, which enabled the use of modern core data
threading models. This means that applications should be able to use
-com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1 when debugging with iOS 10 devices.

Note:
- The armv7s architecture in the frameworks will be removed in 2.4. Devices
which previously used armv7s can continue to be supported using the armv7
architecture. All applications using the default architecture settings
in any supported version of Xcode shouldn't notice any change.
Version 2.2 - February 14, 2017

Resolved Issues

Fixes an issue where the Place Picker viewport was not being centered
correctly (Issue 11206 [https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=11206].)
Fixes an issue where the Autocomplete error delegate method was not called
in all conditions.

Note:
- iOS 7 support is intended to be dropped starting with 2.3. 2.2.x will be
the last release series to support iOS 7.
Version 2.1.1 - November 8, 2016

Resolved Issues

Fixes an issue which caused rotation of the place picker to move the marker.
Reduces the timeout on calls to currentPlace(callback:) to match Android
(Issue 10563 [https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=10563].)

Version 2.1 - September 22, 2016

Resolved Issues

Added workaround for the userEmail triggering false positives during
submission to the Apple app store (Issue 10508 [https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=10508].)
Errors returned from lookUpPlaceID(_:callback:) now have the correct error
domain and codes.

Version 2.0.1 - July 29, 2016

Resolved Issues

Array properties are now correctly typed when accessed from Swift.
(Issue 10183 [https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=10183].)

Version 2.0.0 - July 26, 2016

Improvements

This release splits the Places API from the Maps SDK. Previously, if you
wanted to use the Places API you had to include all of GoogleMaps. As a
result of the split, the final size of the Places API binary is 70% smaller
than the previous combined binary. If you are using only the Maps SDK you
will not be affected unless you have pinned your dependency on GoogleMaps
to a version earlier than 2.0. In this case, you should update this
restriction in your Podfile. If you are using the Places API, see
Migrating to Places SDK for iOS [https://developers.google.com/places/ios-sdk/client-migration].
Places SDK demos [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/code-samples] are now available
separately from Maps demo apps.

Resolved Issues

The Places framework is now available as a download for manual installation.
For details, see Get Started [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/start#step-2-install-the-api].
(Issue 8856 [https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=8856].)
The Places API no longer requests permission to access the user's location
on behalf of the app. This means that existing code which calls
GMSPlacesClient.currentPlaceWithCallback(_:) must be updated to ensure that
the location permission has been granted beforehand.

Version 1.13.2 - May 12, 2016

Resolved Issues

Added a workaround to avoid the false positive for the non-public API
imageWithName: selector. (Issue 9704 [https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=9704].)

Version 1.13.1 - May 02, 2016

Resolved Issues

Fixed an application hang when using a UIView with autolayout enabled as an info
window or as a marker iconView. (Issue 9525 [https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=9525].)
Changed lookUpPlaceID to not call its callback twice in error scenarios.
(Issue 9310 [https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=9310].)

Version 1.13.0 - March 29, 2016

Features

Autocomplete widgets in the Places API now provide options for custom styling.
UIView based markers. Marker content can now show advanced animations by
providing a custom view hierarchy to be displayed through the iconView property.
See the documentation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/marker#use_the_markers_iconview_property] for details.
(Issue 5203 [https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=5203].)
Info windows can now have their custom views animated. Set tracksInfoWindowChanges
on the associated marker to YES to enable real-time updates. (Issue 5559 [https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=5559].)
Map rendering now defaults to 60fps on modern iOS devices. Set the new
preferredFrameRate property on GMSMapView to revert to the old behavior
(Conservative) or a new low frame rate option to save battery (PowerSave).
(Issue 5066 [https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=5066].)
Added mapViewSnapshotReady: to GMSMapViewDelegate which fires when map content,
including markers and other overlays, has been fully rendered.

Resolved Issues

GMSAutocompleteViewController now works when used in a storyboard.
Added missing Place Type constants. (Issue 8121 [https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=8121].)
GMSCoordinateBounds initWithVisibleRegion: now chooses correct bounds for large
viewports.
