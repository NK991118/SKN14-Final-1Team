public     class
SupportMapFragment
extends Fragment

A Map component in an app. This fragment is the simplest way to place a map in an application.
It's a wrapper around a view of a map to automatically handle the necessary life cycle needs.
Being a fragment, this component can be added to an activity's layout file simply with the XML
below.
<fragment
class="com.google.android.gms.maps.SupportMapFragment"
android:layout_width="match_parent"
android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
A GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap] must be acquired using getMapAsync(OnMapReadyCallback) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportMapFragment#getMapAsync(com.google.android.gms.maps.OnMapReadyCallback)]. This class
automatically initializes the maps system and the view.
A view can be removed when the SupportMapFragment's onDestroyView() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportMapFragment#onDestroyView()] method is called and the
GoogleMapOptions.useViewLifecycleInFragment(boolean) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMapOptions#useViewLifecycleInFragment(boolean)] option is set. When this happens the
SupportMapFragment is no longer valid until the view is recreated again later when the SupportMapFragment's
onCreateView(LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportMapFragment#onCreateView(android.view.LayoutInflater,%20android.view.ViewGroup,%20android.os.Bundle)] method is called.
Any objects obtained from the GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap] are associated with the view. It's important
to not hold on to objects (e.g. Marker [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker]) beyond
the view's life. Otherwise it will cause a memory leak as the view cannot be released.
To use this class, you must include the Android support library in your build path.

Public Constructors

public

SupportMapFragment
()

Creates a map fragment. This constructor is public only for use by an inflater. Use newInstance() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportMapFragment#newInstance()] to create a SupportMapFragment programmatically.

Public Methods

public
void

getMapAsync
(OnMapReadyCallback [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/OnMapReadyCallback] callback)

Sets a callback object which will be triggered when the GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap] instance is ready to
be used.
Note that:

This method must be called from the main thread.
The callback will be executed in the main thread.
In the case where Google Play services is not installed on the user's device, the
callback will not be triggered until the user installs it.
In the rare case where the GoogleMap is destroyed immediately after creation, the
callback is not triggered.
The GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap] object provided by the callback is non-null.

Parameters
| callback | The callback object that will be triggered when the map is ready to be used. |
