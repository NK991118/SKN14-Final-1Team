GMSGeometryContainsLocation

extern BOOL GMSGeometryContainsLocation(CLLocationCoordinate2D point,
GMSPath [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPath.html] *_Nonnull path, BOOL geodesic)

Returns whether point lies inside of path. The path is always considered closed, regardless of
whether the last point equals the first or not.

Inside is defined as not containing the South Pole – the South Pole is always outside.

path describes great circle segments if geodesic is YES, and rhumb (loxodromic) segments
otherwise.

If point is exactly equal to one of the vertices, the result is YES. A point that is not equal
to a vertex is on one side or the other of any path segment – it can never be “exactly on the
border”.

See GMSGeometryIsLocationOnPath() for a border test with tolerance.
