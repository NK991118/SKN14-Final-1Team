onMarkerClick
(Marker [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker] marker)

Called when a marker has been clicked or tapped.
Note: the first thing that happens when a marker is clicked or tapped is that any
currently showing info window is closed, and the GoogleMap.OnInfoWindowCloseListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap.OnInfoWindowCloseListener] is
triggered. Then the OnMarkerClickListener is triggered. Therefore, calling Marker.isInfoWindowShown() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker#isInfoWindowShown()] on any marker from the OnMarkerClickListener will return
false.

Parameters
| marker | The marker that was clicked. |
| --- | --- |

Returns
true if the listener has consumed the event (i.e., the default behavior
should not occur); false otherwise (i.e., the default behavior should occur). The
default behavior is for the camera to move to the marker and an info window to appear.
