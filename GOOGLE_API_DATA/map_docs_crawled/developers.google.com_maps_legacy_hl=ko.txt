Legacy products and features

This topic lists all Google Maps Platform products and features that are
currently, or scheduled to be, in the
Legacy [https://developers.google.com/maps/launch-stages#legacy] stage.

How Legacy status works

Legacy is an intermediate lifecycle step to ease the transition between
Generally Available services and Deprecated services.

Legacy-marked services will be officially feature frozen, and new feature
requests will only be considered for updated non-Legacy services.
Legacy-marked services will retain full support.
Existing projects already using Legacy services can continue to do so.

While we envision that Legacy services will be turned down in the coming
years, there is no date yet for when this will happen.

Subject to the Google Maps Platform Terms of
Service [https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms] Deprecation
Policy, we will provide at least a 12-month notice prior to the decommission of
the services.

LegacyApiNotActivatedMapError

Google throws this error when your application is querying a legacy API (Places
API [https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview-legacy], Directions API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview], or Distance Matrix
API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview]) that is not enabled on your project. In most cases, keep legacy APIs
disabled on new projects.

If you own the application that's throwing this error, use the equivalent new
API [https://developers.google.com/maps/legacy#active_services_with_legacy_status] instead.

If you don't own the application that's throwing this error, report this issue
to your application provider by sharing this URL with them, and follow their
instructions to upgrade to a new version. As a short-term solution, consider
activating the legacy API(s):

Places API [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/places-backend.googleapis.com?utm_source=Docs_error_LegacyApiNotActivatedMapError]
Directions API [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/directions-backend.googleapis.com?utm_source=Docs_error_LegacyApiNotActivatedMapError]
Distance Matrix API [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/distance-matrix-backend.googleapis.com?utm_source=Docs_error_LegacyApiNotActivatedMapError]
