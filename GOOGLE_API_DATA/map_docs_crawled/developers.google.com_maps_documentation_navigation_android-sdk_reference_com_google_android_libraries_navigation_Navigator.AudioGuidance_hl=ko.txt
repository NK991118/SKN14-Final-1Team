BLUETOOTH_AUDIO

Specifies that voice guidance should be transmitted over Bluetooth if available. This flag
must be combined with VOICE_ALERTS_ONLY [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator.AudioGuidance#VOICE_ALERTS_ONLY] or VOICE_ALERTS_AND_GUIDANCE [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator.AudioGuidance#VOICE_ALERTS_AND_GUIDANCE] to
have any effect.

Constant Value:

SILENT

Specifies that voice guidance and vibrations should be disabled. This flag should always be
specified by itself; it is a mistake to combine this with any other Navigator.AudioGuidance [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator.AudioGuidance]
flags.

VOICE_ALERTS_AND_GUIDANCE

Specifies that voice should be enabled for both alerts and turn-by-turn guidance
instructions. Note that this value alone will not allow voice guidance to be played over
Bluetooth; to enable that, BLUETOOTH_AUDIO [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator.AudioGuidance#BLUETOOTH_AUDIO] should be added.

Constant Value:

VOICE_ALERTS_ONLY

Specifies that voice should be enabled for alerts only (e.g., traffic incidents) but not for
turn-by-turn guidance instructions. Note that this value alone will not allow voice guidance
to be played over Bluetooth; to enable that, BLUETOOTH_AUDIO [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator.AudioGuidance#BLUETOOTH_AUDIO] should be added.

Constant Value:
