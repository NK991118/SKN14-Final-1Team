public     class
SpeedometerUiOptions
extends Object
implements
Parcelable

Encapsulates speedometer UI configuration for different severity levels of speed alerts,
represented by SpeedAlertSeverity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity].
You can use this class to customize the speedometer UI, such as the colors of the text and
icon background for SpeedAlertSeverity.MINOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MINOR] and SpeedAlertSeverity.MAJOR [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity#MAJOR] speed
alerts.
If you want to customize the triggering thresholds for each SpeedAlertSeverity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity], use
SpeedAlertOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertOptions].
