GMSCALayer

@interface GMSCALayer : CALayer

GMSCALayer is a superclass used by layers in the Google Maps SDK for iOS, such as GMSMapLayer [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMapLayer.html]
and GMSPanoramaLayer [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaLayer.html].

This is an implementation detail and it should not be instantiated directly.
