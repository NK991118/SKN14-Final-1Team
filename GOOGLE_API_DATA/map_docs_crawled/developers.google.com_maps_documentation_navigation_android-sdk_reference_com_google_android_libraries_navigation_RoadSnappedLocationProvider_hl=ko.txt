public     interface
RoadSnappedLocationProvider

Allows subscription to road-snapped user locations. Note that subscribing to road-snapped
location updates may cause battery drain or unintentional collection of user location data if
left running in the background.
Implementations of this interface are thread-safe.

Nested Class Summary
| interface | RoadSnappedLocationProvider.GpsAvailabilityEnhancedLocationListener | A location listener that also listens to the changes in GPS availability. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| interface | RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener | Defines signatures for methods that are called when road-snapped location updates become available. |

Public Method Summary
| abstract void | addLocationListener(RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener listener) Registers a listener for road-snapped location updates. |
| --- | --- |
| abstract void | removeLocationListener(RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener listener) Unregisters the given listener if it is currently registered, otherwise it has no effect. |
| abstract void | resetFreeNav() Attempts to restart the freenav service. |

addLocationListener
(RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener] listener)

Registers a listener for road-snapped location updates.
In order to avoid memory leaks, battery drain, or unintended logging of user location,
removeLocationListener(RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoadSnappedLocationProvider#removeLocationListener(com.google.android.libraries.navigation.RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener)] should be called when the listener is no longer required (for
example, when the app is backgrounded).
Existing registered listeners will stay registered until explicitly removed by a removeLocationListener(RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoadSnappedLocationProvider#removeLocationListener(com.google.android.libraries.navigation.RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener)] call.

Parameters
| listener | the listener to be registered |

removeLocationListener
(RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener] listener)

Unregisters the given listener if it is currently registered, otherwise it has no effect.
Since removal is not synchronous, in rare situations you may still get additional locations
after deregistering.

Parameters
| listener | the listener to be unregistered |

resetFreeNav
()

Attempts to restart the freenav service. This should be called if the service does not appear
to be running normally.
