GMSIndoorDisplay

@interface GMSIndoorDisplay : NSObject

Provides ability to observe or control the display of indoor level data.

Like GMSMapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMapView.html], GMSIndoorDisplay may only be used from the main thread.

GMSIndoorDisplay delegate

Declaration

Swift
weak var delegate: (any GMSIndoorDisplayDelegate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSIndoorDisplayDelegate.html])? { get set }

Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, weak, nullable) id<GMSIndoorDisplayDelegate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSIndoorDisplayDelegate.html]> delegate;

activeBuilding [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSIndoorDisplay#/c:objc(cs)GMSIndoorDisplay(py)activeBuilding]

Provides the currently focused building, will be nil if there is no building with indoor data
currently under focus.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly, nullable) GMSIndoorBuilding [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSIndoorBuilding.html] *activeBuilding;

activeLevel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSIndoorDisplay#/c:objc(cs)GMSIndoorDisplay(py)activeLevel]

Provides and controls the active level for activeBuilding.  Will be updated whenever
activeBuilding changes, and may be set to any member of activeBuildingâ€™s levels property.  May
also be set to nil if the building is underground, to stop showing the building (the building
