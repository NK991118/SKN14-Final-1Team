onIndoorBuildingFocused
()

The map maintains a notion of focused building, which is the building currently
centered in the viewport or otherwise selected by the user through the UI or the location
provider. This callback is called when the focused building changes.
This method will only be called after the building data has become available.
The focused building is not referenced as a parameter of this method due to
synchronization issues: if multiple focus requests are handled, listeners may be notified
out-of-order, so should rely on getFocusedBuilding() itself to provide the most up-to-date
information. It is possible that more than one onIndoorBuildingFocused call will be made
without the focused building actually changing.

onIndoorLevelActivated
(IndoorBuilding [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/IndoorBuilding] building)

The map keeps track of the active level for each building which has been visited or
otherwise had a level selected. When that level changes, this callback will be triggered
regardless of whether the building is focused or not. This callback is also called when the
default level first becomes available.
This method will only be called after the building data has become available.

Parameters
| building | the building for which the active level has changed, never null. |
