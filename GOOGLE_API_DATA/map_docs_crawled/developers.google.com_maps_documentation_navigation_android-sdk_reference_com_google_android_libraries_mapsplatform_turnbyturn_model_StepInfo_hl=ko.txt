the exit number if it exists and null if there is no exit number for the step.

public
String

getFullInstructionText
()

Returns the full text of the instruction for this step.
Examples (each line is a separate step):
Turn left onto Lean Ave
Use the right lane to take the CA-85 ramp to Mtn View
Use the 2nd from the right lane to take exit 9A toward North First Street

Returns
the full text of the instruction for this step.

public
String
