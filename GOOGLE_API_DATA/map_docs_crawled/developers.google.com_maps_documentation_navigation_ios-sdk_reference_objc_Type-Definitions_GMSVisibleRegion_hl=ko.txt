GMSVisibleRegion

typedef struct GMSVisibleRegion [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSVisibleRegion.html] GMSVisibleRegion [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSVisibleRegion.html]

GMSVisibleRegion [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSVisibleRegion.html] contains the four points defining the polygon that is visible in a map’s
camera.

This polygon can be a trapezoid instead of a rectangle, because a camera can have tilt. If the
camera is directly over the center of the camera, the shape is rectangular, but if the camera is
tilted, the shape will appear to be a trapezoid whose smallest side is closest to the point of
view.
