QUOTA_CHECK_FAILED

A route to the destination could not be calculated because of insufficient quota. For calls
to ERROR(/setDestination) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/] or ERROR(/setDestinations) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/] with a route token, the quota is used
from "Set Destination with Route Token". Otherwise the "Set Destination" quota is used.
Address the issue in the "Quotas" section of the Google Cloud Console [https://console.cloud.google.com/]. Quota updates take effect
on the next route request, without needing to restart the app.

stale or invalid place ID.
