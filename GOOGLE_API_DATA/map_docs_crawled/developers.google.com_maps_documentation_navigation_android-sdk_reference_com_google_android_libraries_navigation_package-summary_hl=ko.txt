| --- | --- |
| ListenableResultFuture.OnResultListener<T> | Interface definition for a callback to be invoked when a result is available. |
| NavigationApi.NavigatorListener | Register a NavigatorListener with NavigationApi.getNavigator(Activity, NavigatorListener) to be notified about the status of said Navigator. |
| NavigationApi.OnTermsResponseListener | Register an OnTermsResponseListener with NavigationApi.showTermsAndConditionsDialog(Activity, String, OnTermsResponseListener) to be notified when the user accepts or declines the terms and conditions. |
| NavigationView.OnNightModeChangedListener | Interface for a listener which will be notified when the UI enters or exits "night mode". |
| NavigationView.OnRecenterButtonClickedListener | Interface for a listener which will be notified when the recenter button is clicked. |
| Navigator | A singleton which provides methods for controlling navigation. |
| Navigator.ArrivalListener | Defines signatures for methods that are called when the driver arrives at a waypoint. |
| Navigator.NavigationSessionListener | Defines signatures for methods that are called when a new navigation session starts. |
| Navigator.RemainingTimeOrDistanceChangedListener | Defines signatures for methods that are called when the remaining time or distance to the next destination changes. |
| Navigator.ReroutingListener | Defines signature for methods called when rerouting is requested in response to the vehicle going off the suggested route. |
| Navigator.RouteChangedListener | Defines signatures for methods that are called when the route changes. |
| Navigator.TrafficUpdatedListener | Defines signatures for methods that are called when the route's traffic data gets updated. |
| NotificationContentProvider | This interface is used by ForegroundServiceManager to provide the notification content when a persistent notification is shared. |
| OfflineListener | Callback interface that clients can register to be informed of Offline update state or progress percentage changes. |
| OnNavigationUiChangedListener | Listener interface which notifies when navigation UI changes. |
| PromptVisibilityChangedListener | Listener which will be notified when a prompt is displayed or hidden during guided navigation. |
| RoadSnappedLocationProvider | Allows subscription to road-snapped user locations. |
| RoadSnappedLocationProvider.GpsAvailabilityEnhancedLocationListener | A location listener that also listens to the changes in GPS availability. |
| RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener | Defines signatures for methods that are called when road-snapped location updates become available. |
| RouteInfo | This interface is deprecated. Prior to being deprecated, this class was only available to Mobility Services customers. Please use the computeCustomRoutes method on the Routes Preferred API instead. |
| RouteSegment | A RouteSegment is an immutable class which represents a single "leg" of a journey, either from the device's current position to the destination, or from one destination to a subsequent destination, along with NavigationTrafficData along the segment. |
| Simulator | An interface to send simulated locations to the Nav API, or run the Nav API along simulated routes. |
| SpeedingListener | Callback to notify you the percentage above the speed limit the driver is currently driving at, and the SpeedAlertSeverity. |
