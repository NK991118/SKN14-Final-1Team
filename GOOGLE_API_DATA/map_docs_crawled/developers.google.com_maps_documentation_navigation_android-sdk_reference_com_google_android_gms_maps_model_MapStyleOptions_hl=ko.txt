public  final   class
MapStyleOptions
extends AbstractSafeParcelable

Defines styling options for a GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap].
With style options you can customize the presentation of the standard Google map styles,
changing the visual display of features like roads, parks, and other points of interest. As well
as changing the style of these features, you can also hide features entirely. This means that you
can emphasize particular components of the map or make the map complement the content of your
app.
