public  final   class
VisibleRegion
extends AbstractSafeParcelable

Contains the four points defining the four-sided polygon that is visible in a map's camera. This
polygon can be a trapezoid instead of a rectangle, because a camera can have tilt. If the camera
is directly over the center of the camera, the shape is rectangular, but if the camera is tilted,
the shape will appear to be a trapezoid whose smallest side is closest to the point of view.

Fields

public
final
LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng]

farLeft

LatLng object that defines the far left corner of the camera.

public
final
LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng]

farRight

LatLng object that defines the far right corner of the camera.

public
final
LatLngBounds [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLngBounds]

latLngBounds

The smallest bounding box that includes the visible region defined in this class.
If this box crosses the 180° meridian (the vertical line from north to south), the
longitude in farRight [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/VisibleRegion#farRight] will be negative and the longitude in farLeft [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/VisibleRegion#farLeft] will be
positive. This rule also applies to nearRight [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/VisibleRegion#nearRight] and nearLeft [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/VisibleRegion#nearLeft].

nearLeft

LatLng object that defines the bottom left corner of the camera.

nearRight

LatLng object that defines the bottom right corner of the camera.

VisibleRegion
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] nearLeft, LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] nearRight, LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] farLeft, LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] farRight, LatLngBounds [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLngBounds] latLngBounds)

Creates a new VisibleRegion given the four corners of the camera. The LatLng parameters must
define a convex shape (the edges of the resulting shape mustn't cross). No bounds checking is
performed at runtime.

Parameters
| nearLeft | a LatLng object containing the latitude and longitude of the near left corner of the region. |
| --- | --- |
| nearRight | a LatLng object containing the latitude and longitude of the near right corner of the region. |
| farLeft | a LatLng object containing the latitude and longitude of the far left corner of the region. |
| farRight | a LatLng object containing the latitude and longitude of the far right corner of the region. |
| latLngBounds | the smallest bounding box that includes the visible region defined in this class. If this box crosses the 180° meridian (the vertical line from north to south), the longitude in farRight will be negative and the longitude in farLeft will be positive. Same applies to nearRight and nearLeft. |

Public Methods

public
boolean

equals
(Object o)

Compares this VisibleRegion [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/VisibleRegion] to another object. If the other object is actually a
pointer to this object, or if all four corners and the bounds of the two objects are the same,
this method returns true. Otherwise, this method returns false.

Parameters
| o | an Object. Return true if both objects are the same object, or if all four corners and the bounds of the two objects are the same. Return false otherwise. |
