Polyline
extends Object

A polyline is a list of points, where line segments are drawn between consecutive points. A
polyline has the following properties:

Points
The vertices of the line. Line segments are drawn between consecutive points. A polyline is
not closed by default; to form a closed polyline, the start and end points must be
the same.
Width
Line segment width in screen pixels. The width is constant and independent of the camera's
zoom level. The default value is 10.
Color
Line segment color in ARGB format, the same format used by Color [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Color.html].
The default value is black (0xff000000).
Start/end cap
Defines the shape to be used at the start or end of a polyline. Supported cap types: ButtCap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/ButtCap], SquareCap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/SquareCap], RoundCap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/RoundCap] (applicable for solid stroke pattern) and
CustomCap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/CustomCap] (applicable for any stroke pattern). Default for both start and end:
ButtCap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/ButtCap].
Joint type
The joint type defines the shape to be used when joining adjacent line segments at all
vertices of the polyline except the start and end vertices. See JointType [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/JointType] for
supported joint types. The default value is JointType.DEFAULT [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/JointType#DEFAULT].
Stroke pattern
Solid (default, represented by null) or a sequence of PatternItem [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/PatternItem] objects
to be repeated along the line. Available PatternItem types: Gap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Gap] (defined by
gap length in pixels), Dash [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Dash] (defined by line width and dash length in pixels) and
Dot [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Dot] (circular, centered on the line, diameter defined by line width in pixels).
Z-Index
The order in which this tile overlay is drawn with respect to other overlays (including
GroundOverlay [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/GroundOverlay]s, TileOverlay [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/TileOverlay]s, Circle [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Circle]s, and Polygon [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Polygon]s but not
Marker [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker]s). An overlay with a larger z-index is drawn over overlays with smaller
z-indices. The order of overlays with the same z-index is arbitrary. The default zIndex is
0.
Visibility
Indicates if the polyline is visible or invisible, i.e., whether it is drawn on the map. An
invisible polyline is not drawn, but retains all of its other properties. The default is
true, i.e., visible.
Geodesic status
Indicates whether the segments of the polyline should be drawn as geodesics, as opposed to
straight lines on the Mercator projection. A geodesic is the shortest path between two
points on the Earth's surface. The geodesic curve is constructed assuming the Earth is a
sphere
Clickability
If you want to handle events fired when the user clicks the polyline, set this property to
true. You can change this value at any time. The default is false. If this
property is set to true, your app will receive notifications to the GoogleMap.OnPolylineClickListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap.OnPolylineClickListener] registered through GoogleMap.setOnPolylineClickListener(GoogleMap.OnPolylineClickListener) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#setOnPolylineClickListener(com.google.android.gms.maps.GoogleMap.OnPolylineClickListener)].
Tag
An Object associated with the polyline. For example, the Object can contain
data about what the polyline represents. This is easier than storing a separate Map<Polyline, Object>. As another example, you can associate a String ID
corresponding to the ID from a data set. Google Maps SDK for Android neither reads nor
writes this property.
Spans
Defines the spans with different styles used to render this polyline. You can use this
property to create a polyline with different StrokeStyle [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/StrokeStyle] on different segments of
the polyline.

Methods in this class must be called on the Android UI thread. If not, an IllegalStateException [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/reference/java/lang/IllegalStateException.html] will be thrown at runtime.
Example
GoogleMap map;
Polyline line = map.addPolyline(new PolylineOptions()
.add(new LatLng(51.5, -0.1), new LatLng(40.7, -74.0))
.width(5)
.color(Color.RED));

public
void

setPoints
(List<LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng]> points)

Sets the points of this polyline. This method will take a copy of the points, so further
mutations to points will have no effect on this polyline.

Parameters
| points | an list of LatLngs that are the vertices of the polyline. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setSpans
(List<StyleSpan [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/StyleSpan]> spans)

public
void

setTag
(Object tag)

Sets the tag for the polyline.
You can use this property to associate an arbitrary Object with this polyline. For
example, the Object can contain data about what the polyline represents. This is easier
than storing a separate Map<Polyline, Object>. As another example, you can associate a
String ID corresponding to the ID from a data set. Google Maps SDK for Android neither
reads nor writes this property. It is your responsibility to call setTag(null) to clear
the tag when you no longer need it, to prevent memory leaks in your app.

Parameters
| tag | if null, the tag is cleared. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setVisible
(boolean visible)

Sets the visibility of this polyline. When not visible, a polyline is not drawn, but it keeps
all its other properties.

Parameters
| visible | if true, then the polyline is visible; if false, it is not. |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setWidth
(float width)

Sets the width of this polyline.

Parameters
| width | the width in screen pixels |
| --- | --- |

public
void

setZIndex
(float zIndex)

Sets the zIndex of this polyline. Polylines with higher zIndices are drawn above those with
lower indices.
