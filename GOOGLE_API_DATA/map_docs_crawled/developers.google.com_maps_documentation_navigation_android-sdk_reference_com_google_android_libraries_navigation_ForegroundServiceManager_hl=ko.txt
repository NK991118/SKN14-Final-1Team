public     class
ForegroundServiceManager
extends Object

This class allows clients to share a persistent notification by using a common notification id.
If a client wants to share a persistent notification, they should use startForeground(Service) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/ForegroundServiceManager#startForeground(android.app.Service)]
and stopForeground(Service) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/ForegroundServiceManager#stopForeground(android.app.Service)] to move their services in and out of the foreground. Clients can
customize the notification by implementing the NotificationContentProviderBase [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NotificationContentProviderBase] abstract
class before calling NavigationApi.initForegroundServiceManagerProvider(Application, Integer, NotificationContentProvider) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationApi#initForegroundServiceManagerProvider(android.app.Application,%20java.lang.Integer,%20com.google.android.libraries.navigation.NotificationContentProvider)] or more simply
with NavigationApi.initForegroundServiceManagerMessageAndIntent(Application, Integer, String, Intent) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationApi#initForegroundServiceManagerMessageAndIntent(android.app.Application,%20java.lang.Integer,%20java.lang.String,%20android.content.Intent)]. Otherwise, a default
notification will be provided.
