GMSPanoramaCamera

@interface GMSPanoramaCamera : NSObject

GMSPanoramaCamera is used to control the viewing direction of a GMSPanoramaView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaView.html]. It does not
contain information about which particular panorama should be displayed.

-initWithOrientation:zoom:FOV: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaCamera#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaCamera(im)initWithOrientation:zoom:FOV:]

Designated initializer. Configures this GMSPanoramaCamera with orientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaCamera.html#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaCamera(py)orientation], zoom [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaCamera.html#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaCamera(py)zoom] and FOV [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaCamera.html#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaCamera(py)FOV].
These values will be clamped to acceptable ranges.

Declaration

Swift
init(orientation: GMSOrientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSOrientation.html], zoom: Float, fov FOV [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaCamera.html#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaCamera(py)FOV]: Double)

Objective-C
- (nonnull id)initWithOrientation:(GMSOrientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSOrientation.html])orientation
zoom:(float)zoom

Declaration

Swift
convenience init(orientation: GMSOrientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSOrientation.html], zoom: Float)

Objective-C
+ (nonnull instancetype)cameraWithOrientation:(GMSOrientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSOrientation.html])orientation

Declaration

Swift
convenience init(heading: CLLocationDirection, pitch: Double, zoom: Float)

Objective-C
+ (nonnull instancetype)cameraWithHeading:(CLLocationDirection)heading
pitch:(double)pitch
Convenience constructor for GMSPanoramaCamera, specifying all camera properties with heading
and pitch as part of orientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaCamera.html#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaCamera(py)orientation].

Declaration

Objective-C
+ (nonnull instancetype)cameraWithOrientation:(GMSOrientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSOrientation.html])orientation
zoom:(float)zoom
Convenience constructor for GMSPanoramaCamera, specifying all camera properties.

Declaration

Swift
convenience init(heading: CLLocationDirection, pitch: Double, zoom: Float, fov FOV [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaCamera.html#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaCamera(py)FOV]: Double)

Objective-C
+ (nonnull instancetype)cameraWithHeading:(CLLocationDirection)heading
pitch:(double)pitch
zoom:(float)zoom
The field of view (FOV) encompassed by the larger dimension (width or height) of the view in
degrees at zoom 1. This is clamped to the range [1, 160] degrees, and has a default value of 90.

Lower FOV values produce a zooming in effect; larger FOV values produce an fisheye effect.

Note: This is not the displayed FOV if zoom is anything other than 1.  User zoom gestures
control the zoom property, not this property.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly) double FOV;

zoom [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaCamera#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaCamera(py)zoom]

Adjusts the visible region of the screen.  A zoom of N will show the same area as the central
width/N height/N area of what is shown at zoom 1.

Zoom is clamped to the implementation defined range [1, 5].

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly) float zoom;

orientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPanoramaCamera#/c:objc(cs)GMSPanoramaCamera(py)orientation]

The camera orientation, which groups together heading and pitch.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly) GMSOrientation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Structs/GMSOrientation.html] orientation;
