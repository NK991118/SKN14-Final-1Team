GMSNavigationTravelMode

enum GMSNavigationTravelMode : NSInteger {}

The different travel modes that can be used for navigation.

GMSNavigationTravelModeDriving [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationTravelMode#/c:@E@GMSNavigationTravelMode@GMSNavigationTravelModeDriving]

Driving routes will be fetched, and the reported user course will be based on the direction of
movement.

Declaration

Swift
case driving = 0

Objective-C
GMSNavigationTravelModeDriving = 0

GMSNavigationTravelModeCycling [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationTravelMode#/c:@E@GMSNavigationTravelMode@GMSNavigationTravelModeCycling]

Cycling routes will be fetched, and the reported user course will be based on the compass
direction the device is facing.

Note: During cycling navigation, the chevron always points in the direction that the
user’s device is facing (toward the top of the device in landscape mode). Keep in mind that
when testing with an emulator, neither the chevron direction nor the map orientation will
appear to change. However, when using a physical device, the map orientation will change when
the device is rotated, while the chevron continues to point in the direction that the device
is facing.

Declaration

Swift
case cycling = 1

Objective-C
GMSNavigationTravelModeCycling

GMSNavigationTravelModeWalking [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationTravelMode#/c:@E@GMSNavigationTravelMode@GMSNavigationTravelModeWalking]

Walking routes will be fetched, and the reported user course will be based on the compass
direction the device is facing.

Note: During walking navigation, the chevron always points in the direction that the
user’s device is facing (toward the top of the device in landscape mode). Keep in mind that
when testing with an emulator, neither the chevron direction nor the map orientation will
appear to change. However, when using a physical device, the map orientation will change when
the device is rotated, while the chevron continues to point in the direction that the device
is facing.

Declaration

Swift
case walking = 2

Objective-C
GMSNavigationTravelModeWalking

GMSNavigationTravelModeTwoWheeler [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationTravelMode#/c:@E@GMSNavigationTravelMode@GMSNavigationTravelModeTwoWheeler]

Two-wheeler routes will be fetched, and the reported user course will be based on the direction
of movement.

Declaration

Swift
case twoWheeler = 3

Objective-C
GMSNavigationTravelModeTwoWheeler

GMSNavigationTravelModeTaxicab [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationTravelMode#/c:@E@GMSNavigationTravelMode@GMSNavigationTravelModeTaxicab]

Taxicab routes will be fetched, and the reported user course will be based on the direction
of movement. This is an experimental feature.

Declaration

Swift
case taxicab = 4

Objective-C
GMSNavigationTravelModeTaxicab
