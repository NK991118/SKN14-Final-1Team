GMSNavigationWaypoint

@interface GMSNavigationWaypoint : NSObject <NSCopying, NSMutableCopying>

An immutable waypoint class, used to specify navigation destinations. It may be initialized from
a CLLocationCoordinate2D or a Google Place ID.

title [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationWaypoint(py)title]

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property(nonatomic, readonly) NSString *title

coordinate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationWaypoint(py)coordinate]

The coordinates of the waypoint. This is kCLLocationCoordinate2DInvalid if this waypoint was
initialized from a Place ID.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly) CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinate;

placeID [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationWaypoint(py)placeID]

The Place ID of this waypoint. This is nil if this waypoint was initialized from coordinates.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, copy, readonly, nullable) NSString *placeID;

preferSameSideOfRoad [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationWaypoint(py)preferSameSideOfRoad]

Whether it is preferred to route the driver to the same side of the
road. The route will arrive on the preferred side of the road unless there is a significant
delay caused by a road closure or slow-moving traffic. Default to NO.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly) BOOL preferSameSideOfRoad;

preferredHeading [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationWaypoint(py)preferredHeading]

An angle used to express the direction of traffic on the side of the road that the vehicle
should arrive on. Consequently, it is not useful for one-way streets.
Units expressed in degrees [0, 360], where 0 means North and angles increase clockwise.
Default and unset value is -1.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly) int32_t preferredHeading;

vehicleStopover [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationWaypoint(py)vehicleStopover]

Indicates that the waypoint is meant for vehicles to stop at, where the intention is to either
pickup or drop-off. When you set this value, waypoints on roads that are unsuitable for pickup
and drop-off may be adjusted to a more suitable location. This option works only for DRIVE and
TWO_WHEELER travel modes. Default to NO. Note: In certain cases, particularly in metro areas,
waypoints can not be set within tunnels even if vehicleStopover is set to NO.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, readonly) BOOL vehicleStopover;

-initWithLocation:title: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationWaypoint(im)initWithLocation:title:]

Initializes this GMSNavigationWaypoint to represent a location specified by 2D coordinates.

Declaration

Swift
init?(location: CLLocationCoordinate2D, title: String)

Objective-C
- (nullable instancetype)initWithLocation:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)location
| location | The location of this waypoint. |
| --- | --- |

Return Value
An instance of GMSNavigationWaypoint, or nil if the location is not valid.

-initWithPlaceID:title: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationWaypoint(im)initWithPlaceID:title:]

Initializes this GMSNavigationWaypoint to represent a location specified by a Place ID.

Declaration

Swift
init?(placeID: String, title: String)

Objective-C
- (nullable instancetype)initWithPlaceID:(nonnull NSString *)placeID
| placeID | The Google Place ID for this waypoint. |
| --- | --- |
| title | A string representing the name of the waypoint. |

Return Value
An instance of GMSNavigationWaypoint, or nil if the Place ID string is nil or empty.

-initWithLocation:title:preferSameSideOfRoad: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationWaypoint(im)initWithLocation:title:preferSameSideOfRoad:]

Initializes GMSNavigationWaypoint to represent a location specified by 2D coordinates and side
of road preferences.

Declaration

Swift
convenience init?(location: CLLocationCoordinate2D, title: String, preferSameSideOfRoad: Bool)

Objective-C
- (nullable instancetype)initWithLocation:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)location
| location | The latitude and longitude of the waypoint. |
| --- | --- |
| title | A string representing the name of the waypoint. |
| preferSameSideOfRoad | Whether it is preferred to route the driver to the same side of the road. The route will arrive on the preferred side of the road unless there is a significant delay caused by a road closure or slow-moving traffic. |

Return Value
An instance of GMSNavigationWaypoint, or nil if the location is not valid.

-initWithLocation:title:preferredSegmentHeading: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint#/c:objc(cs)GMSNavigationWaypoint(im)initWithLocation:title:preferredSegmentHeading:]

Initializes GMSNavigationWaypoint to represent a location specified by 2D coordinates and side
of road preferences.

Declaration

Swift
convenience init?(location: CLLocationCoordinate2D, title: String, preferredSegmentHeading: Int32)

Objective-C
- (nullable instancetype)initWithLocation:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)location
| location | The latitude and longitude of the waypoint. |
| --- | --- |
| title | A string representing the name of the waypoint. |
| preferredSegmentHeading | An angle used to express the direction of traffic on the side of the road that the vehicle should arrive on. Consequently, it is not useful for one-way streets. Units expressed in degrees [0, 360], where 0 means North. |

Return Value
An instance of GMSNavigationWaypoint, or nil if the location or the
preferredSegmentHeading is not valid.
