IS_ROAD_SNAPPED_KEY

Bundle key for the Location object returned in onLocationChanged(Location) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoadSnappedLocationProvider.LocationListener#onLocationChanged(android.location.Location)]. When available,
maps to a boolean value that indicates whether the location was snapped to the best available
road. Note that this value may sometimes have hiccups and may differ from what aGMM UI shows.
Retrieve the value with location.getExtras().getBoolean(LocationListener.IS_ROAD_SNAPPED_KEY)

road-snapped events are not sent.
