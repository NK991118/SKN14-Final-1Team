참고: 서버 측 및 클라이언트 측 라이브러리

Places API는 Google 지도 서비스용 Java 클라이언트, Python 클라이언트, Go 클라이언트, Node.js 클라이언트 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/client-library?hl=ko]에서도 사용할 수 있습니다.
Places API 및 클라이언트 라이브러리는 서버 애플리케이션에서 사용하기 위한 것입니다.

클라이언트 측 애플리케이션을 빌드하는 경우 Android용 Places SDK (신규) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk?hl=ko], iOS용 Places SDK (신규) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk?hl=ko], Maps JavaScript API의 장소 라이브러리 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places?hl=ko]를 참고하세요.

주변 검색 (기존)을 사용하면 지정된 영역 내에서 장소를 검색할 수 있습니다. 키워드를 제공하거나 검색하려는 장소 유형을 지정하여 검색 요청을 구체화할 수 있습니다.

주변 검색 (기존) 및 텍스트 검색 (기존)은 선택된 장소에 사용 가능한 모든 데이터 필드 (지원되는 필드의 하위 집합 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-data-fields?hl=ko#places-api-fields-support])를 반환하며 자동으로 요금이 청구 [https://developers.google.com/maps/billing/understanding-cost-of-use?hl=ko#nearby-search]됩니다. 특정 필드만 반환하도록 주변 검색 (기존) 또는 텍스트 검색 (기존)을 제한할 수 있는 방법은 없습니다.
필요하지 않은 데이터를 요청하고 비용을 지불하지 않으려면 장소 찾기(기존) 요청 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search?hl=ko#FindPlaceRequests]을 대신 사용하세요.

주변 검색 (기존) 요청

Nearby Search (레거시) 요청은 다음 형식의 HTTP URL입니다.

https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/output?parameters

여기서 output은 다음 값 중 하나일 수 있습니다.

json (권장)은 JavaScript 객체 표기법 (JSON)의 출력을 나타냅니다.
xml는 XML로 출력을 나타냅니다.

근처 검색 (기존) 요청을 시작하려면 특정 매개변수가 필요합니다. URL에서와 마찬가지로 모든 매개변수는 앰퍼샌드(&) 문자를 사용하여 구분합니다.

Required parameterslocation
The point around which to retrieve place information. This must be
specified as latitude,longitude.
radius
Defines the distance (in meters) within which to return place results. You
may bias results to a specified circle by passing a
location and a radius parameter. Doing so
instructs the Places service to prefer showing results within
that circle; results outside of the defined area may still be displayed.

The radius will automatically be clamped to a maximum value depending on
the type of search and other parameters.
Autocomplete: 50,000 meters
Nearby Search:
with keyword or name: 50,000 meters
without keyword or name
Up to 50,000 meters, adjusted dynamically based on area density,
independent of rankby parameter.

When using rankby=distance, the radius parameter
will not be accepted, and will result in an
INVALID_REQUEST.
Query Autocomplete: 50,000 metersText Search: 50,000 metersOptional parameterskeyword
The text string on which to search, for example: "restaurant" or "123 Main
Street". This must be a place name, address, or category of
establishments. Any other types of input can generate errors and are not
guaranteed to return valid results. The Google Places service will return
candidate matches based on this string and order the results based on
their perceived relevance.

Explicitly including location information using this parameter may
conflict with the location, radius, and rankby parameters, causing
unexpected results.

If this parameter is omitted, places with a business_status of
CLOSED_TEMPORARILY or CLOSED_PERMANENTLY will not be returned.
languageThe language in which to return results.
See the
list of supported languages [https://developers.google.com/maps/faq?hl=ko#languagesupport]. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
exhaustive.

If language is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
preferred language as specified in the
Accept-Language header.

The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
component.

If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
closest match.

The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
valid in one language but not in another. For example, utca and
tér are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
maxprice
Restricts results to only those places within the specified range. Valid
values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most expensive), inclusive.
The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from region to
region.
minprice
Restricts results to only those places within the specified range. Valid
values range between 0 (most affordable) to 4 (most expensive), inclusive.
The exact amount indicated by a specific value will vary from region to
region.
namename is deprecated.
Equivalent to keyword. Values in this field are combined with
values in the keyword field and passed as part of the same
search string.
opennow
Returns only those places that are open for business at the time the query
is sent. Places that do not specify opening hours in the Google Places
database will not be returned if you include this parameter in your query.
pagetoken
Returns up to 20 results from a previously run search. Setting a
pagetoken parameter will execute a search with the same
parameters used previously — all parameters other than pagetoken will be
ignored.
rankbySpecifies the order in which results are listed. Possible values are:prominence (default). This option sorts results based on
their importance. Ranking will favor prominent places within the set
radius over nearby places that match but that are less prominent.
Prominence can be affected by a place's ranking in Google's index,
global popularity, and other factors. When prominence is specified, the
radius parameter is required.
distance. This option biases search results in ascending
order by their distance from the specified location. When
distance is specified, one or more of keyword,
name, or type is required and
radius is disallowed.
type
Restricts the results to places matching the specified type. Only one type
may be specified. If more than one type is provided, all types following
the first entry are ignored.
type=hospital|pharmacy|doctor becomes
type=hospitaltype=hospital,pharmacy,doctor is ignored entirely
See the list of
supported types [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types?hl=ko].

Note: Adding both `keyword` and `type` with the same value
(`keyword=cafe&type=cafe` or `keyword=parking&type=parking`) can yield
`ZERO_RESULTS`.

추가 결과 액세스

기본적으로 각 응답은 쿼리당 최대 20개의 establishment 결과를 반환하지만 각 검색은 세 페이지에 걸쳐 최대 60개까지의 결과를 반환할 수 있습니다. 검색에서 20개 이상의 결과가 반환되는 경우 검색 응답에 추가 값인 next_page_token이 포함됩니다. 새 요청의 pagetoken 매개변수에 next_page_token 값을 전달하여 다음 결과 집합을 확인합니다.

next_page_token이 null이거나 반환되지 않으면 추가 결과가 없습니다.
동일한 next_page_token로 요청을 다시 시도하면 결과의 다음 페이지가 반환됩니다.
pagetoken을 설정하면 다른 모든 매개변수가 무시됩니다.
원래 질문 후 최대 두 번까지 새 페이지를 요청할 수 있습니다.
next_page_token를 사용하는 요청을 포함한 각 요청은 사용량 한도 계산 시 하나의 요청으로 간주되며 별도로 청구됩니다.
next_page_token가 발급된 시점과 유효해지는 시점 사이에 몇 초의 지연 시간이 있습니다. 다음 페이지를 사용할 수 있기 전에 요청하면 INVALID_REQUEST 응답이 반환됩니다. next_page_token가 포함된 요청에는 항상 요금이 청구됩니다.
참고: next_page_token을 올바르게 사용하는 방법은 사용자가 요청한 경우에만 결과의 다음 페이지를 요청하는 것입니다. 사용자가 끝까지 스크롤하면 한 번에 20개의 결과를 표시하는 실제 페이징을 구현하거나 결과 페이지 하단에 장소를 추가하는 것이 좋습니다.
