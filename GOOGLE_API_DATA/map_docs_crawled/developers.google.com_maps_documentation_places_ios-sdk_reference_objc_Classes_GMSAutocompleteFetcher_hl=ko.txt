GMSAutocompleteFetcher

@interface GMSAutocompleteFetcher : NSObject

GMSAutocompleteFetcher is a wrapper around the lower-level autocomplete APIs that encapsulates
some of the complexity of requesting autocomplete predictions as the user is typing. Calling
sourceTextHasChanged will generally result in the provided delegate being called with
autocomplete predictions for the queried text, with the following provisos:

The fetcher may not necessarily request predictions on every call of sourceTextHasChanged if
several requests are made within a short amount of time.
The delegate will only be called with prediction results if those predictions are for the
text supplied in the most recent call to sourceTextHasChanged.

-initWithFilter: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFetcher#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFetcher(im)initWithFilter:]

Initialize the fetcher.

Declaration

Swift
init(filter: GMSAutocompleteFilter [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter.html]?)

Objective-C
- (nonnull instancetype)initWithFilter:(nullable GMSAutocompleteFilter [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter.html] *)filter;

Parameters
| filter | The filter to apply to the results. This parameter may be nil. |
| --- | --- |

delegate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFetcher#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFetcher(py)delegate]

Delegate to be notified with autocomplete prediction results.

Declaration

Swift
weak var delegate: (any GMSAutocompleteFetcherDelegate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSAutocompleteFetcherDelegate.html])? { get set }

Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, weak, nullable) id<GMSAutocompleteFetcherDelegate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSAutocompleteFetcherDelegate.html]> delegate;

autocompleteFilter [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFetcher#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFetcher(py)autocompleteFilter]

Filter to apply to autocomplete suggestions (can be nil).

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, strong, nullable) GMSAutocompleteFilter [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter.html] *autocompleteFilter;

-provideSessionToken: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFetcher#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFetcher(im)provideSessionToken:]

Provide a GMSAutocompleteSessionToken [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteSessionToken.html] for tracking the specific autocomplete query flow.

Declaration

Swift
func provide(_ sessionToken: GMSAutocompleteSessionToken [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteSessionToken.html]?)

Objective-C
- (void)provideSessionToken:
(nullable GMSAutocompleteSessionToken [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteSessionToken.html] *)sessionToken;

-sourceTextHasChanged: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFetcher#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFetcher(im)sourceTextHasChanged:]

Notify the fetcher that the source text to autocomplete has changed.

This method should only be called from the main thread. Calling this method from another thread
will result in undefined behavior. Calls to GMSAutocompleteFetcherDelegate [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSAutocompleteFetcherDelegate.html] methods will also be
called on the main thread.

This method is non-blocking.

Declaration

Swift
func sourceTextHasChanged(_ text: String?)

Objective-C
- (void)sourceTextHasChanged:(nullable NSString *)text;

Parameters
| text | The partial text to autocomplete. |
