the destination.

Freezing support for iOS 12 -  October 18, 2021

In response to changes in our internal dependencies, we are freezing support for
iOS 12 in an upcoming major version of Google Maps Platform SDKs for iOS.

Navigation SDK for iOS v4.0 or higher will only support devices running a
minimum of iOS 13.

Apps built with v3.x of the Maps SDK for iOS will continue to work for iOS 12.
If your dependencies in CocoaPods or Carthage don't specify a version number,
Xcode will load the newest version and new builds of your app won't support iOS 12.

Steps to take

In your Podfile or Cartfile, specify the 3.x versions of
Navigation SDK for iOS.
See examples of CocoaPods and Carthage dependencies for
Maps [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/versions#installation] and
Places [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/versions#installation] SDK
for iOS.
Each time you build a new version of your app, run pod outdated or
carthage outdated to check for new versions of your CocoaPods or
Carthage dependencies. See the guidance on
app maintenance best practices [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/versions#maintenance].
Don't upgrade to v4.0 or higher for Navigation SDK for iOS until you are
ready to drop support of iOS 12 for your app.

Version 2.2 - Freezing support for iOS 11 (July 20, 2021)

In response to changes in our internal dependencies, we are freezing support of
iOS 11 in an upcoming major version of Google Maps Platform
SDKs for iOS. Earlier SDK versions will continue supporting iOS 11.

The following SDK versions will only support devices running a minimum of iOS
12:

Maps SDK for iOS or Places SDK for iOS v6.0 or higher
Navigation SDK for iOS v3.0 or higher
Rides & Deliveries Driver or Consumer SDK v1.0 or higher

Apps built with v5.x of the Maps and Places SDKs for iOS and v2.x of the
Navigation SDK will continue to work for iOS 11. If your dependencies
in CocoaPods or Carthage don't specify a version number, Xcode will load
the newest version and new builds of your app won't support iOS 11.

Steps to take

In your Podfile or Cartfile, specify the 5.x versions of
Maps and Places SDKs,
and version 2.0 for Navigation SDK, which were released earlier
this year. See examples of CocoaPods and Carthage dependencies for
Maps [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/versions#installation] and
Places [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/versions#installation] SDK
for iOS.
Each time you build a new version of your app, run pod outdated or
carthage outdated to check for new versions of your CocoaPods or
Carthage dependencies. See the guidance on
app maintenance best practices [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/versions#maintenance].
Don't upgrade to v6.0 or higher for Maps and Places SDKs, or v3.0 or higher
for Navigation SDK, until you are ready to drop support of
iOS 11 for your app.

Version 2.1 (June 28, 2021)

Features

Setting destinations with a route token [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/route_token]
now supports two-wheeler travel mode.
Setting followingZoomLevel now takes effect immediately in following mode;
after starting a new navigation session, the camera does not zoom out.
Added a setTransactionIDs:errorHandler [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigator#-settransactionids:errorhandler:]
method in GMSNavigator. Use this method to set the ongoing transaction IDs
which apply to the navigation events during the current navigation session.

Support freezes [https://developers.google.com/maps/software-support]

Support for iOS 11 will be frozen in an upcoming major version.

Version 2.0 (May 13, 2021)

Decommissions

iOS 10 is no longer supported. The minimum OS is now 11.0.
ARMv7 32-bit architecture no longer supported.
The deprecated GMSNavigatorDelegate and
GMSRoadSnappedLocationProviderDelegate protocols will change the protocol
names to GMSNavigatorListener and GMSRoadSnappedLocationProviderListener,
respectively. All previous delegate methods will exist in the new listeners,
with the following exceptions.

GMSNavigator and GMSRoadSnappedLocationProvider removed the
deprecated property delegate. Instead, call methods -addListener:
and -removeListener, respectively, to add or remove the replacement
listeners.
GMSNavigatorDelegate methods -
(NSTimeInterval)navigatorTimeUpdateThreshold:(GMSNavigator *)navigator
and - (CLLocationDistance)navigatorDistanceUpdateThreshold:(GMSNavigator
*)navigator are removed. Instead, set the timeUpdateThreshold and
distanceUpdateThreshold properties on GMSNavigator directly.

GooglePlaces.framework won't be included in the Navigation SDK for iOS
Zip package in the next Navigation SDK release. If you need the
Places SDK in your application, follow the Places SDK for iOS
installation instructions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/start].

Version 1.16.0 (March 8, 2021)

Support for iOS 10 will be dropped in version 2.0.0.

Features:

Added a navigationMapStyle property to the
GMSUISettings [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSUISettings]
class. The map will display 2D building outlines at zoom level 18+ when this
property is set to GMSNavigationMapStyleHighDetail.
Added a followingZoomLevel property to the
GMSMapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMapView]
class. You can use this property to set the zoom level when the camera is in
following mode during navigation.
Added a stopGuidanceAtArrival property to the GMSNavigator [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigator]
class. You can use this property to determine whether guidance should
automatically stop when navigator:didArriveAtWaypoint: is called.
Updated the Objective-C and Swift demos.

Bug fixes:

Fixed an issue where the SDK would crash when attempting to get the traveled
path upon a navigator route change.

Version 1.15.1 (January 21, 2021)

Bug fixes:

Fixes an issue where the camera mode [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMapView]
wouldn't switch to
GMSNavigationCameraModeFree [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationNavState]
if set to
GMSNavigationCameraModeFollowing [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationNavState].

Version 1.15.0 (December 8, 2020)

Features:

Added crash detection during SDK initialization. In cases where two or more
consecutive crashes are detected at initialization time, the SDK will attempt
to restore functionality by automatically resetting cached client parameters
and map tile data. A recovery attempt event will be logged unless the client
has opted out of unexpected termination reporting.

Version 1.14.0 (October 13, 2020)

Features:

Support for iOS 9.0 has been dropped. The new minimum is iOS 10.0.
The new minimum version of Xcode is 11.7.
By default, unexpected SDK terminations, such as app crashes while the SDK is
still running, are monitored to let Google to improve SDK stability when
applicable. There is also an option to opt-out by using the setAbnormalTerminationReportingEnabled:
API on GMSNavigationServices.

Version 1.13.0 (August 24, 2019)

Features:

You can now pass a route token to the Navigation SDK to retrieve the
route represented by that route token. The route token is associated with a
route response when you call the Routes Preferred
API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes_preferred]. Learn more about custom
routes [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes_preferred/custom_routes].
Added a vehicleStopover [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationWaypoint]
property to the GMSNavigationWaypoint class. This feature relocates the
waypoint to a nearby place if its location is not suitable for a vehicle to
make a stop.
Added a mutable waypoint class, GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSNavigationMutableWaypoint]
which lets you change some waypoint properties.
Added GMSNavigatorListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSNavigatorListener] and
GMSRoadSnappedLocationProviderListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSRoadSnappedLocationProviderListener]
protocols, which enable multiple classes to listen to important navigation
and road snapping events.

Deprecations

GMSNavigatorDelegate and GMSRoadSnappedLocationProviderDelegate
protocols are deprecated as of August 24, 2020. Instead, use
GMSNavigatorListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSNavigatorListener]
and
GMSRoadSnappedLocationProviderListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSRoadSnappedLocationProviderListener].

Note:

To build apps using the Navigation SDK, the current minimum IDE
version supported is Xcode 11.5.

Version 1.12.0 (December 2, 2019)

Features:

You can now request routes with a target distance, so that routes will be
ranked by their absolute delta to the target distance from smallest to
largest. To do this, initialize routingOptions using the
initWithTargetDistancesMeters (GMSNavigationRoutingOptions.h), and then
call setDistinations (GMSNavigator.h), passing the routing options.

Note:

To build apps using the Navigation SDK, the current minimum IDE
version supported is Xcode 11.0.

Version 1.11.0 (October 28, 2019)

Features:

Drivers can now receive speed alerts when they exceed speed limits. Speed
alerts are enabled through shouldDisplaySpeedometer and configurable
through GMSNavigationSpeedAlertOptions and
GMSNavigationSpeedometerUIOptions.
Note: As set out in the Google Maps Enterprise terms of service, Google makes
no warranties regarding the quality of any feature including the accuracy of
the speed alert feature. This feature is intended to be used by operators
for informational purposes only

Known issues

A recent change in the map tile rendering code may cause a low-volume crash
with signature 'gmscore::renderer::GLState::BindBuffer'. This bug is not
known to occur on the Navigation API, but other google maps products with
shared code. We advise caution when using the 1.7.0 release. The iOS 1.3.4
release has an older version of the renderer and wouldn't exhibit this
release has an older version of the renderer and wouldn't exhibit this
crash.

New Style Default Opt-In for Nav SDK 1.6+ (Aug 21, 2018)

The new basemap style has been enabled by default in the Maps SDK for iOS,
however it is NOT enabled for Nav SDK users. Compiling the Nav SDK and Maps
SDK together will cause your project to be opted out of the new basemap
style. Therefore, contrary to the instructions for the Maps
SDK [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/releases#new_style_default_june_28_2018],
Nav SDK users will need to explicitly opt-in.

To opt-in, use the code snippet below. The best place to do this in your
app is right after providing your API key, using GMSServices provideAPIKey.
You must be using at least Version 1.6 in order to opt-in.
NSArray *options = @[@"B3MWHUG2MR0DQW"];
BOOL didSetApiOptions = [GMSServices provideAPIOptions:options];
NSLog(@"Options were set: %d", didSetApiOptions);

Version 1.6.1 (July 13, 2018)

Stability and Bug fixes

Fixed a compiler setting issue where movi.2d instructions are not generated
as movi.16b
Removed third-party BoringSSL dependency

Major Dependency Updates

Added third-party OpenLocationCode dependency
(https://github.com/google/open-location-code)
Removed third-party BoringSSL dependency

Known issues

A recent change in the map tile rendering code may cause a low-volue crash
with signature 'gmscore::renderer::GLState::BindBuffer'. This bug is not known to
occur on the Navigation API, but other google maps products with shared code.
We advise caution when using the 1.6.1 release. The iOS 1.3.4 release has an older
version of the renderer and wouldn't exhibit this crash.

Version 1.3.4 (July 13, 2018)

Stability and Bug fixes

Fixed a compiler setting issue where movi.2d instructions are not generated
as movi.16b
Removed third-party BoringSSL dependency

Major Dependency Updates

Added third-party OpenLocationCode dependency
(https://github.com/google/open-location-code)
Removed third-party BoringSSL dependency

Version 1.6 (May 10, 2018)

Stability and Bug fixes

Added an error code which is returned when a stale Place ID is provided.
Made sure the navigation header starts updating again automatically after
being scrolled if the user catches up to the maneuver which they
scrolled to.
Route callouts no longer disappear while a user pans the map.
When using simulated locations, guidance cards are no longer blank.

Version 1.3.3 (March 26, 2017)

Known issues

Nav SDK doesn't have built-in support for iPhone X safe areas. When
mapView.navigationEnabled is YES, the mapView won't automatically place
map controls within the safe areas and the paddingAdjustmentBehavior
property will have no effect.
The location simulator may sometimes get into a state where multiple
simulated location sources are active simultaneously. This can cause the
navigation engine to stop working and present a grey navigation header to
the user. This has not been observed when using real GPS location updates.
Route ETA labels sometimes disappear whilst the user is panning the map.
The navigation header won't automatically start updating again if the
user scrolls the header and then drives past the maneuver they have scrolled
to.

Bug fixes and improvements.

This version is functionally identical to v1.3.

Version 1.3.2 (Jan 23, 2017)

Added a mitigation for Open GL crashes with stack traces containing
gmscore::renderer::ios::GLRenderTarget::FrameEnd() where the process is killed
by SIGABRT. This change is expected to reduce the rate of these crashes but
not fix them completely. The underlying issue is believed to be in Apple's Open
GL implementation.

Version 1.3.1 (December 21, 2017)

Changed the build process for the frameworks to stop using the
-bitcode_hide_symbols flag in the prelinking stage. This causes non-exported
symbols to be included in the bitcode bundle which may allow app stack traces to
be symbolicated to a greater extent.

This version is functionally identical to v1.3.

Version 1.3 (November 6, 2017)

Features:

Added a mapViewDidTapRecenterButton: method which is called on the
GMSMapViewNavigationUIDelegate when the user taps the re-center button.

Resolved Issues:

Fixed an issue where the distance to the next turn was not shown in the
navigation header.
Fixed an issue where the ETA for the current route was displayed
unnecessarily when guidance is active and was not updated as navigation
progressed.

Version 1.2 (October 26, 2017)

Resolved Issues:

Fixed an issue where Google Navigation SDK for iOS would sometimes report a
location unavailable error if the user was stationary.

Note: Support for Xcode 7.3 has been dropped. The new minimum is Xcode 8.0.
Version 1.1.1 (October 24, 2017)

Features:

Added the option to disable bluetooth audio output using the new
audioDeviceType property on GMSNavigator.

Resolved Issues:

Fixed an issue where setting the navigationFooterEnabled property to NO
sometimes didn't work.

Version 1.1 (August 24, 2017)

Miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.
NOTICE: Xcode 7 is no longer supported as of version 1.2.

Version 1.0 (July 5, 2017)

Launch of the Navigation SDK for iOS.
