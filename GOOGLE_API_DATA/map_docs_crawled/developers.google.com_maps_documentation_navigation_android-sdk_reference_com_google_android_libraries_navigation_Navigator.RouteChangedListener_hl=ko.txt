Navigator.RouteChangedListener

Defines signatures for methods that are called when the route changes. All notifications will
occur on the UI thread.
Note that there are several types of triggers for this listener, including but not limited
to:

the route was generated
the driver diverged from the current route
the driver selected an alternative route from the UI (before or after starting
navigation)
the driver was offered or required to use a better route
the driver started navigating to a destination (via a call to Navigator.startGuidance() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator#startGuidance()])
the driver started navigating to a new waypoint after arriving at a previous one (via a
call to Navigator.continueToNextDestination() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator#continueToNextDestination()])
the route was cleared (via a call to Navigator.clearDestinations() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator#clearDestinations()])
