GMSPolygonLayer

@interface GMSPolygonLayer : GMSOverlayLayer [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSOverlayLayer.html]

GMSPolygonLayer is a subclass of GMSOverlayLayer [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSOverlayLayer.html], available on a per-polygon basis, that
allows animation of several properties of its associated GMSPolygon [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPolygon.html].

Note that this CALayer is never actually rendered directly, as GMSMapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSMapView.html] is provided
entirely via an OpenGL layer. As such, adjustments or animations to ‘default’ properties of
CALayer will not have any effect.

strokeWidth [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPolygonLayer#/c:objc(cs)GMSPolygonLayer(py)strokeWidth]

The width of the polygon outline in screen points.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) CGFloat strokeWidth;

strokeColor [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPolygonLayer#/c:objc(cs)GMSPolygonLayer(py)strokeColor]

The color of the polygon outline. This is an assign property, there is an expectation for the
GMSPolygon [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPolygon.html] to own the reference if necessary.

Declaration

Swift
unowned(unsafe) var strokeColor: CGColor? { get set }

Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, nullable) CGColorRef strokeColor;

fillColor [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPolygonLayer#/c:objc(cs)GMSPolygonLayer(py)fillColor]

The fill color. This is an assign property, there is an expectation for the GMSPolygon [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPolygon.html] to own
the reference if necessary.

Declaration

Swift
unowned(unsafe) var fillColor: CGColor? { get set }

Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, nullable) CGColorRef fillColor;
