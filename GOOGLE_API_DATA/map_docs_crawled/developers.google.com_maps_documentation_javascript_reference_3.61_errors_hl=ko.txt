google.maps.MapsServerError
class

Represents a server-side error from a web service (i.e. the equivalent of a 5xx code in HTTP).
This class extends
MapsNetworkError [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.61/errors#MapsNetworkError].

RPCStatus [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.61/errors#RPCStatus]
constants

google.maps.RPCStatus
constants

The status returned by a web service. See https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html [https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html].
Access by calling const {RPCStatus} = await google.maps.importLibrary("core"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constants |
| --- |
| ABORTED | The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort. |
| ALREADY_EXISTS | The entity that a client attempted to create (e.g., file or directory) already exists. |
| CANCELLED | The operation was cancelled, typically by the caller. |
| DATA_LOSS | Unrecoverable data loss or corruption. |
| DEADLINE_EXCEEDED | The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long. |
| FAILED_PRECONDITION | The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. |
| INTERNAL | Internal errors. This means that some invariants expected by the underlying system have been broken. This error code is reserved for serious errors. |
| INVALID_ARGUMENT | The client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from FAILED_PRECONDITION. INVALID_ARGUMENT indicates arguments that are problematic regardless of the state of the system (e.g., a malformed file name). |
| NOT_FOUND | Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found. |
| OK | Not an error; returned on success. |
| OUT_OF_RANGE | The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or reading past end-of-file. Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT, this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current file size. |
| PERMISSION_DENIED | The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation. This error code does not imply the request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies other pre-conditions. |
| RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED | Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space. |
| UNAUTHENTICATED | The request does not have valid authentication credentials for the operation. |
| UNAVAILABLE | The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a backoff. Note that it is not always safe to retry non-idempotent operations. |
| UNIMPLEMENTED | Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled in this service. |
| UNKNOWN | Unknown error. For example, this error may be returned when a status received from another address space belongs to an error space that is not known in this address space. Also errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information may be converted to this error. |
