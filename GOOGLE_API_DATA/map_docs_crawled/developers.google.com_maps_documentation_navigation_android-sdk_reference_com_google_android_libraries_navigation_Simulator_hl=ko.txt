public     interface
Simulator

An interface to send simulated locations to the Nav API, or run the Nav API along simulated
routes. For use during testing, debugging and demos.
Implementations of this interface are thread-safe.

setUserLocation
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] location)

Sets a simulated user location.

showDummyTrafficPrompt
()

Shows a dummy traffic prompt. Useful for testing the prompt UI.
This method only works if guidance is running.

simulateLocationsAlongExistingRoute
()

Begins simulating travel along the route currently calculated by the Navigator. If the
Navigator has not calculated a route, this does nothing.
Simulation will be run using the default SimulationOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SimulationOptions].

simulateLocationsAlongExistingRoute
(SimulationOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SimulationOptions] options)

Begins simulating travel along the route currently calculated by the Navigator. If the
Navigator has not calculated a route, this does nothing.

ListenableResultFuture [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/ListenableResultFuture]<Navigator.RouteStatus [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator.RouteStatus]>

simulateLocationsAlongNewRoute
(List<Waypoint [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Waypoint]> waypoints, RoutingOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions] routingOptions)

Calculates a route through the given waypoints (as would be calculated by
Navigator.setDestinations()), and simulate travel along this route. Travel will be started just
before the future returns OK. If the future returns anything except OK, nothing will be
simulated.
Simulation will be run using the default SimulationOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SimulationOptions].

simulateLocationsAlongNewRoute
(List<Waypoint [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Waypoint]> waypoints)

Calculates a route through the given waypoints (as would be calculated by
Navigator.setDestinations()), and simulate travel along this route. Travel will be started just
before the future returns OK. If the future returns anything except OK, nothing will be
simulated.
The route will be calculated using the default RoutingOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoutingOptions].
