Ranks routes by NavSDK default cost model. This is the default routing strategy for navigating.

Declaration

Swift
case defaultBest = 0

Objective-C
GMSNavigationRoutingStrategyDefaultBest = 0

GMSNavigationRoutingStrategyShorter [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationRoutingStrategy#/c:@E@GMSNavigationRoutingStrategy@GMSNavigationRoutingStrategyShorter]

Ranks routes by distance. The highest ranking route is the shortest of those returned.

Declaration

Swift
case shorter = 1

Objective-C
GMSNavigationRoutingStrategyShorter

GMSNavigationRoutingStrategyDeltaToTargetDistance [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSNavigationRoutingStrategy#/c:@E@GMSNavigationRoutingStrategy@GMSNavigationRoutingStrategyDeltaToTargetDistance]
