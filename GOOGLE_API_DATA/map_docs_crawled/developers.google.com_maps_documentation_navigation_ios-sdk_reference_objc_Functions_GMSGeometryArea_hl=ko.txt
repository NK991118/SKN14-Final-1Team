GMSGeometryArea

extern double GMSGeometryArea(GMSPath [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSPath.html] *_Nonnull path)

Returns the area of a geodesic polygon defined by path on Earth.

The “inside” of the polygon is defined as not containing the South pole.

If path is not closed, it is implicitly treated as a closed path nevertheless and the result is
the same.

All coordinates of the path must be valid.

The polygon must be simple (not self-overlapping) and may be concave.

If any segment of the path is a pair of antipodal points, the result is undefined – because two
antipodal points do not form a unique great circle segment on the sphere.
