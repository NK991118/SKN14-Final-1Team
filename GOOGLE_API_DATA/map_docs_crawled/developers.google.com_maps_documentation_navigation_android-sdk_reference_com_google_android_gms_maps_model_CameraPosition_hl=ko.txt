public  final   class
CameraPosition
extends AbstractSafeParcelable
implements
ReflectedParcelable

An immutable class that aggregates all camera position parameters such as location, zoom level,
tilt angle, and bearing. Use CameraPosition.Builder [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/CameraPosition.Builder] to construct a CameraPosition [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/CameraPosition]
instance, which you can then use in conjunction with CameraUpdateFactory [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/CameraUpdateFactory]. For more information, see Moving
the camera [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/views#moving_the_camera].

Fields

public
final
float

bearing

Direction that the camera is pointing in, in degrees clockwise from north.

public
final
LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng]

target

The location that the camera is pointing at.

public
final
float

tilt

The angle, in degrees, of the camera angle from the nadir (directly facing the Earth). See
CameraPosition.Builder.tilt(float) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/CameraPosition.Builder#tilt(float)] for details of
restrictions on the range of values.

public
final
float

zoom

Zoom level near the center of the screen. See CameraPosition.Builder.zoom(float) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/CameraPosition.Builder#zoom(float)] for the definition of the
camera's zoom level.

Public Constructors

public

CameraPosition
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] target, float zoom, float tilt, float bearing)

Constructs a CameraPosition.

Parameters
| target | The target location to align with the center of the screen. |
| --- | --- |
| zoom | Zoom level at target. See CameraPosition.Builder.zoom(float) for details of restrictions. |
| tilt | The camera angle, in degrees, from the nadir (directly down). See CameraPosition.Builder.tilt(float) for details of restrictions. |
| bearing | Direction that the camera is pointing in, in degrees clockwise from north. This value will be normalized to be within 0 degrees inclusive and 360 degrees exclusive. |

Throws
| NullPointerException | if target is null |
| --- | --- |
| IllegalArgumentException | if tilt is outside the range of 0 to 90 degrees inclusive. |

fromLatLngZoom
(LatLng [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLng] target, float zoom)

Constructs a CameraPosition pointed for a particular target and zoom level. The resultant
bearing is North, and the viewing angle is perpendicular to the Earth's surface. i.e., directly
facing the Earth's surface, with the top of the screen pointing North.

Parameters
| target | The target location to align with the center of the screen. |
| --- | --- |
| zoom | Zoom level at target. See CameraPosition.Builder.zoom(float) for details on the range the value will be clamped to. The larger the value the more zoomed in the camera is. |
