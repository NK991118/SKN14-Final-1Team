Method: projects.databases.importDocuments

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Imports documents into Google Cloud Firestore. Existing documents with the same name are overwritten. The import occurs in the background and its progress can be monitored and managed via the Operation resource that is created. If an databases.importDocuments operation is cancelled, it is possible that a subset of the data has already been imported to Cloud Firestore.

HTTP request
POST https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/{name=projects/*/databases/*}:importDocumentsThe URL uses gRPC Transcoding [https://google.aip.dev/127] syntax.

Path parameters
| Parameters |
| --- |
| name | string Required. Database to import into. Should be of the form: projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}. |

Request body
The request body contains data with the following structure:

| JSON representation |
| --- |
| {   "collectionIds": [     string   ],   "inputUriPrefix": string,   "namespaceIds": [     string   ] } |

| Fields |
| --- |
| collectionIds[] | string Which collection IDs to import. Unspecified means all collections included in the import. Each collection ID in this list must be unique. |
| inputUriPrefix | string Location of the exported files. This must match the outputUriPrefix of an ExportDocumentsResponse from an export that has completed successfully. See: google.firestore.admin.v1.ExportDocumentsResponse.output_uri_prefix. |
