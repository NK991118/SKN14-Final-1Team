Query Explain report reference

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The following values are returned as results to operations performed with
Firestore Query Explain [https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-explain].
Note: Query Explain is designed for useful ad hoc analysis; its report
format will evolve to maximize ease of reading and understanding, not
suitability for machine processing. Some metrics are expected to change
as Cloud Firestore evolves (i.e., metrics may be added, removed, or updated) and
are not covered by the same deprecation policy as other Cloud Firestore APIs. The
following tables indicate which portions of the data are subject to change.
