| Fields |
| --- |
| name | string The resource name of the Database. Format: projects/{project}/databases/{database} |
| uid | string Output only. The system-generated UUID4 for this Database. |
| createTime | string (Timestamp format) Output only. The timestamp at which this database was created. Databases created before 2016 do not populate createTime. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z", "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30". |
| updateTime | string (Timestamp format) Output only. The timestamp at which this database was most recently updated. Note this only includes updates to the database resource and not data contained by the database. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z", "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30". |
| deleteTime | string (Timestamp format) Output only. The timestamp at which this database was deleted. Only set if the database has been deleted. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z", "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30". |
| locationId | string The location of the database. Available locations are listed at https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/locations. |

| concurrencyMode | enum (ConcurrencyMode) The concurrency control mode to use for this database. |
| versionRetentionPeriod | string (Duration format) Output only. The period during which past versions of data are retained in the database. Any read or query can specify a readTime within this window, and will read the state of the database at that time. If the PITR feature is enabled, the retention period is 7 days. Otherwise, the retention period is 1 hour. A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with 's'. Example: "3.5s". |
| earliestVersionTime | string (Timestamp format) Output only. The earliest timestamp at which older versions of the data can be read from the database. See [versionRetentionPeriod] above; this field is populated with now - versionRetentionPeriod. This value is continuously updated, and becomes stale the moment it is queried. If you are using this value to recover data, make sure to account for the time from the moment when the value is queried to the moment when you initiate the recovery. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z", "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30". |
| pointInTimeRecoveryEnablement | enum (PointInTimeRecoveryEnablement) Whether to enable the PITR feature on this database. |
| appEngineIntegrationMode | enum (AppEngineIntegrationMode) The App Engine integration mode to use for this database. |
| keyPrefix | string Output only. The keyPrefix for this database. This keyPrefix is used, in combination with the project ID ("~") to construct the application ID that is returned from the Cloud Datastore APIs in Google App Engine first generation runtimes. This value may be empty in which case the appid to use for URL-encoded keys is the projectId (eg: foo instead of v~foo). |
| deleteProtectionState | enum (DeleteProtectionState) State of delete protection for the database. |
| cmekConfig | object (CmekConfig) Optional. Presence indicates CMEK is enabled for this database. |
| previousId | string Output only. The database resource's prior database ID. This field is only populated for deleted databases. |
| sourceInfo | object (SourceInfo) Output only. Information about the provenance of this database. |
| tags | map (key: string, value: string) Optional. Input only. Immutable. Tag keys/values directly bound to this resource. For example: "123/environment": "production", "123/costCenter": "marketing" An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }. |
| etag | string This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding. |
| databaseEdition | enum (DatabaseEdition) Immutable. The edition of the database. |
| freeTier | boolean Output only. Background: Free tier is the ability of a Firestore database to use a small amount of resources every day without being charged. Once usage exceeds the free tier limit further usage is charged. Whether this database can make use of the free tier. Only one database per project can be eligible for the free tier. The first (or next) database that is created in a project without a free tier database will be marked as eligible for the free tier. Databases that are created while there is a free tier database will not be eligible for the free tier. |
