Updates a field configuration. Currently, field updates apply only to single field index configuration. However, calls to FirestoreAdmin.UpdateField [https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/reference/rest/v1/projects.databases.collectionGroups.fields/patch#google.firestore.admin.v1.FirestoreAdmin.UpdateField] should provide a field mask to avoid changing any configuration that the caller isn't aware of. The field mask should be specified as: { paths: "indexConfig" }.This call returns a google.longrunning.Operation [https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/reference/rest/Shared.Types/Operation] which may be used to track the status of the field update. The metadata for the operation will be the type FieldOperationMetadata [https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/reference/rest/Shared.Types/FieldOperationMetadata].To configure the default field settings for the database, use the special Field with resource name: projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/collectionGroups/__default__/fields/*.

HTTP request
PATCH https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/{field.name=projects/*/databases/*/collectionGroups/*/fields/*}The URL uses gRPC Transcoding [https://google.aip.dev/127] syntax.

Path parameters
| Parameters |
| --- |
| field.name | string Required. A field name of the form: projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/collectionGroups/{collectionId}/fields/{fieldPath} A field path can be a simple field name, e.g. address or a path to fields within mapValue , e.g. address.city, or a special field path. The only valid special field is *, which represents any field. Field paths can be quoted using ` (backtick). The only character that must be escaped within a quoted field path is the backtick character itself, escaped using a backslash. Special characters in field paths that must be quoted include: *, ., ` (backtick), [, ], as well as any ascii symbolic characters. Examples: `address.city` represents a field named address.city, not the map key city in the field address. `*` represents a field named *, not any field. A special Field contains the default indexing settings for all fields. This field's resource name is: projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/collectionGroups/__default__/fields/* Indexes defined on this Field will be applied to all fields which do not have their own Field index configuration. |

Query parameters
| Parameters |

| updateMask | string (FieldMask format) A mask, relative to the field. If specified, only configuration specified by this field_mask will be updated in the field. This is a comma-separated list of fully qualified names of fields. Example: "user.displayName,photo". |
