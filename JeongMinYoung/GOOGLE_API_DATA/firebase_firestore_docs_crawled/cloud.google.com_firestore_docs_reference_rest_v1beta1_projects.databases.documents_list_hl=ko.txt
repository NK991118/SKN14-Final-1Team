Lists documents.

HTTP request
GET https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1beta1/{parent=projects/*/databases/*/documents/*/**}/{collectionId}The URL uses gRPC Transcoding [https://google.aip.dev/127] syntax.

Path parameters
| Parameters |
| --- |
| parent | string Required. The parent resource name. In the format: projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/documents or projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/documents/{document_path}. For example: projects/my-project/databases/my-database/documents or projects/my-project/databases/my-database/documents/chatrooms/my-chatroom |
| collectionId | string Optional. The collection ID, relative to parent, to list. For example: chatrooms or messages. This is optional, and when not provided, Firestore will list documents from all collections under the provided parent. |

Query parameters
| Parameters |
| --- |
| pageSize | integer Optional. The maximum number of documents to return in a single response. Firestore may return fewer than this value. |
| pageToken | string Optional. A page token, received from a previous documents.list response. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters (with the exception of pageSize) must match the values set in the request that generated the page token. |
| orderBy | string Optional. The optional ordering of the documents to return. For example: priority desc, __name__ desc. This mirrors the ORDER BY used in Firestore queries but in a string representation. When absent, documents are ordered based on __name__ ASC. |
| mask | object (DocumentMask) Optional. The fields to return. If not set, returns all fields. If a document has a field that is not present in this mask, that field will not be returned in the response. |
| showMissing | boolean If the list should show missing documents. A document is missing if it does not exist, but there are sub-documents nested underneath it. When true, such missing documents will be returned with a key but will not have fields, createTime, or updateTime set. Requests with showMissing may not specify where or orderBy. |
| Union parameter consistency_selector. The consistency mode for this transaction. If not set, defaults to strong consistency. consistency_selector can be only one of the following: |
| transaction | string (bytes format) Perform the read as part of an already active transaction. A base64-encoded string. |
| readTime | string (Timestamp format) Perform the read at the provided time. This must be a microsecond precision timestamp within the past one hour, or if Point-in-Time Recovery is enabled, can additionally be a whole minute timestamp within the past 7 days. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and uses 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z", "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30". |
