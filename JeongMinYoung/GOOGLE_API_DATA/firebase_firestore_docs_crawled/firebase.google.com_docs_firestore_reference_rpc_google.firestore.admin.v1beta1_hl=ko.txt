FirestoreAdmin

The Cloud Firestore Admin API.This API provides several administrative services for Cloud Firestore.

Concepts
Project, Database, Namespace, Collection, and Document are used as defined in the Google Cloud Firestore API.Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.

Services

Index
The index service manages Cloud Firestore indexes.Index creation is performed asynchronously. An Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous operation. The state of the operation (including any errors encountered) may be queried via the Operation resource.

Metadata
Provides metadata and statistical information about data in Cloud Firestore. The data provided as part of this API may be stale.

Operation
The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the specified Project (including any Operations in progress). Operations are not created directly but through calls on other collections or resources.An Operation that is not yet done may be cancelled. The request to cancel is asynchronous and the Operation may continue to run for some time after the request to cancel is made.An Operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as part of the Operation collection.Operations are created by service FirestoreAdmin, but are accessed via service google.longrunning.Operations.

| CreateIndex |
| --- |
| rpc CreateIndex(CreateIndexRequest) returns (Operation) Creates the specified index. A newly created index's initial state is CREATING. On completion of the returned google.longrunning.Operation, the state will be READY. If the index already exists, the call will return an ALREADY_EXISTS status. During creation, the process could result in an error, in which case the index will move to the ERROR state. The process can be recovered by fixing the data that caused the error, removing the index with delete, then re-creating the index with create. Indexes with a single field cannot be created. Authorization scopes Requires one of the following OAuth scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform For more information, see the OAuth 2.0 Overview. |

| DeleteIndex |
| --- |
| rpc DeleteIndex(DeleteIndexRequest) returns (Empty) Deletes an index. Authorization scopes Requires one of the following OAuth scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform For more information, see the OAuth 2.0 Overview. |

| ExportDocuments |
| --- |
| rpc ExportDocuments(ExportDocumentsRequest) returns (Operation) Exports a copy of all or a subset of documents from Google Cloud Firestore to another storage system, such as Google Cloud Storage. Recent updates to documents may not be reflected in the export. The export occurs in the background and its progress can be monitored and managed via the Operation resource that is created. The output of an export may only be used once the associated operation is done. If an export operation is cancelled before completion it may leave partial data behind in Google Cloud Storage. Authorization scopes Requires one of the following OAuth scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform For more information, see the OAuth 2.0 Overview. |

| GetIndex |
| --- |
| rpc GetIndex(GetIndexRequest) returns (Index) Gets an index. Authorization scopes Requires one of the following OAuth scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform For more information, see the OAuth 2.0 Overview. |

| ImportDocuments |
| --- |
| rpc ImportDocuments(ImportDocumentsRequest) returns (Operation) Imports documents into Google Cloud Firestore. Existing documents with the same name are overwritten. The import occurs in the background and its progress can be monitored and managed via the Operation resource that is created. If an ImportDocuments operation is cancelled, it is possible that a subset of the data has already been imported to Cloud Firestore. Authorization scopes Requires one of the following OAuth scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform For more information, see the OAuth 2.0 Overview. |

| ListIndexes |
| --- |
| rpc ListIndexes(ListIndexesRequest) returns (ListIndexesResponse) Lists the indexes that match the specified filters. Authorization scopes Requires one of the following OAuth scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform For more information, see the OAuth 2.0 Overview. |
