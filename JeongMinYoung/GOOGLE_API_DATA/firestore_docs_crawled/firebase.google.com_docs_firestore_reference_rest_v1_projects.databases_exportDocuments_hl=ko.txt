Method: projects.databases.exportDocuments

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Exports a copy of all or a subset of documents from Google Cloud Firestore to another storage system, such as Google Cloud Storage. Recent updates to documents may not be reflected in the export. The export occurs in the background and its progress can be monitored and managed via the Operation resource that is created. The output of an export may only be used once the associated operation is done. If an export operation is cancelled before completion it may leave partial data behind in Google Cloud Storage.For more details on export behavior and output format, refer to: https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/manage-data/export-import [https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/manage-data/export-import]

HTTP request
POST https://firestore.googleapis.com/v1/{name=projects/*/databases/*}:exportDocumentsThe URL uses gRPC Transcoding [https://google.aip.dev/127] syntax.

Path parameters
| Parameters |
| --- |
| name | string Required. Database to export. Should be of the form: projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}. |

Request body
The request body contains data with the following structure:

| JSON representation |
| --- |
| {   "collectionIds": [     string   ],   "outputUriPrefix": string,   "namespaceIds": [     string   ],   "snapshotTime": string } |

| Fields |
| --- |
| collectionIds[] | string Which collection IDs to export. Unspecified means all collections. Each collection ID in this list must be unique. |
| outputUriPrefix | string The output URI. Currently only supports Google Cloud Storage URIs of the form: gs://BUCKET_NAME[/NAMESPACE_PATH], where BUCKET_NAME is the name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket and NAMESPACE_PATH is an optional Google Cloud Storage namespace path. When choosing a name, be sure to consider Google Cloud Storage naming guidelines: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming. If the URI is a bucket (without a namespace path), a prefix will be generated based on the start time. |
| namespaceIds[] | string An empty list represents all namespaces. This is the preferred usage for databases that don't use namespaces. An empty string element represents the default namespace. This should be used if the database has data in non-default namespaces, but doesn't want to include them. Each namespace in this list must be unique. |
| snapshotTime | string (Timestamp format) The timestamp that corresponds to the version of the database to be exported. The timestamp must be in the past, rounded to the minute and not older than earliestVersionTime. If specified, then the exported documents will represent a consistent view of the database at the provided time. Otherwise, there are no guarantees about the consistency of the exported documents. Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and uses 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z", "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z" or "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30". |
