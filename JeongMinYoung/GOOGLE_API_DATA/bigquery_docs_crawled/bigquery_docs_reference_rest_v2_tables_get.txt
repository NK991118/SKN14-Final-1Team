Query parameters
Parameters
selectedFields
string
tabledata.list of table schema fields to return (comma-separated). If unspecified, all fields are returned. A fieldMask cannot be used here because the fields will automatically be converted from camelCase to snake_case and the conversion will fail if there are underscores. Since these are fields in BigQuery table schemas, underscores are allowed.
view
enum (TableMetadataView)
Optional. Specifies the view that determines which table information is returned. By default, basic table information and storage statistics (STORAGE_STATS) are returned.
Request body
The request body must be empty.
Response body
If successful, the response body contains an instance of Table.
Authorization scopes
Requires one of the following OAuth scopes:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery.readonly
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform.read-only
For more information, see the Authentication Overview.
TableMetadataView
TableMetadataView specifies which table information is returned.
Enums
TABLE_METADATA_VIEW_UNSPECIFIED The default value. Default to the STORAGE_STATS view.
BASIC Includes basic table information including schema and partitioning specification. This view does not include storage statistics such as numRows or numBytes. This view is significantly more efficient and should be used to support high query rates.
STORAGE_STATS Includes all information in the BASIC view as well as storage statistics (numBytes, numLongTermBytes, numRows and lastModifiedTime).
FULL Includes all table information, including storage statistics. It returns same information as STORAGE_STATS view, but may contain additional information in the future.
