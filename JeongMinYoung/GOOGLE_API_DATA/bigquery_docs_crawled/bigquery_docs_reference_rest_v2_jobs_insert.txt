Method: jobs.insert
bookmark_border
Starts a new asynchronous job.
This API has two different kinds of endpoint URIs, as this method supports a variety of use cases.
The Metadata URI is used for most interactions, as it accepts the job configuration directly.
The Upload URI is ONLY for the case when you're sending both a load job configuration and a data stream together. In this case, the Upload URI accepts the job configuration and the data as two distinct multipart MIME parts.
HTTP request
Upload URI, for media upload requests:
POST https://bigquery.googleapis.com/upload/bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}/jobs
Metadata URI, for metadata-only requests:
POST https://bigquery.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2/projects/{projectId}/jobs
The URL uses gRPC Transcoding [https://google.aip.dev/127] syntax.
Path parameters
Parameters
projectId
string
