Query parameters
Parameters
accessPolicyVersion
integer
Optional. The version of the provided access policy schema. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected.
This version refers to the schema version of the access policy and not the version of access policy. This field's value can be equal or more than the access policy schema provided in the request. For example, * Operations updating conditional access policy binding in datasets must specify version 3. Some of the operations are : - Adding a new access policy entry with condition. - Removing an access policy entry with condition. - Updating an access policy entry with condition. * But dataset with no conditional role bindings in access policy may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. If unset or if 0 or 1 value is used for dataset with conditional bindings, request will be rejected.
This field will be mapped to IAM Policy version (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/policies#versions) and will be used to set policy in IAM.
