filter
string
An expression for filtering the results of the request by label. The syntax is labels.<name>[:<value>]. Multiple filters can be AND-ed together by connecting with a space. Example: labels.department:receiving labels.active. See Filtering datasets using labels for details.
Request body
The request body must be empty.
Response body
Response format for a page of results when listing datasets.
If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:
JSON representation

```
{
  "kind": string,
  "etag": string,
  "nextPageToken": string,
  "datasets": [
    {
      "kind": string,
      "id": string,
      "datasetReference": {
        object (DatasetReference)
      },
      "labels": {
        string: string,
        ...
      },
      "friendlyName": string,

}
```

Fields
kind
string
Output only. The resource type. This property always returns the value "bigquery#datasetList"
etag
string
Output only. A hash value of the results page. You can use this property to determine if the page has changed since the last request.

string
A token that can be used to request the next results page. This property is omitted on the final results page.
datasets[]
object
An array of the dataset resources in the project. Each resource contains basic information. For full information about a particular dataset resource, use the Datasets: get method. This property is omitted when there are no datasets in the project.
datasets[].kind
string
The resource type. This property always returns the value "bigquery#dataset"
datasets[].id
string
The fully-qualified, unique, opaque ID of the dataset.
datasets[].datasetReference
object (DatasetReference)
The dataset reference. Use this property to access specific parts of the dataset's ID, such as project ID or dataset ID.
datasets[].labels
map (key: string, value: string)
The labels associated with this dataset. You can use these to organize and group your datasets.
datasets[].friendlyName
string
An alternate name for the dataset. The friendly name is purely decorative in nature.
datasets[].location
string
The geographic location where the dataset resides.
datasets[].externalDatasetReference
object (ExternalDatasetReference)
Output only. Reference to a read-only external dataset defined in data catalogs outside of BigQuery. Filled out when the dataset type is EXTERNAL.
unreachable[]
string
A list of skipped locations that were unreachable. For more information about BigQuery locations, see: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations [https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations]. Example: "europe-west5"
