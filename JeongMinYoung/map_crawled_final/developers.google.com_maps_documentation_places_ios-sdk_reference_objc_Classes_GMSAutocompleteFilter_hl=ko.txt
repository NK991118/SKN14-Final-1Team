GMSAutocompleteFilter

@interface GMSAutocompleteFilter : NSObject

This class represents a set of restrictions that may be applied to autocomplete requests. This
allows customization of autocomplete suggestions to only those places that are of interest.

type [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFilter(py)type]

Deprecated
type property is deprecated in favor of types [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter.html#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFilter(py)types].

DEPRECATED. The type filter applied to an autocomplete request to restrict results to different
types. Default value is kGMSPlacesAutocompleteTypeFilterNoFilter.

NOTE: Ignored if the “types” property is set.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) GMSPlacesAutocompleteTypeFilter [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Enums/GMSPlacesAutocompleteTypeFilter.html] type;

types [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFilter(py)types]

The filter applied to an autocomplete request to restrict results using up to 5 different place
types.

NOTE: This API can take an array of up to 5 entries.
If you are using GMSAutocompleteRequest [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteRequest.html], this API can take types from table_A [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/place-types].
Otherwise, take data from table_1 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/supported_types#table1]
or table_2 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/supported_types#table2],
but only a single entry in table_3 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/supported_types#table3].
Default value is null, which means no filters specified. Overrides the deprecated “type” property
if this is set.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, nullable) NSArray<NSString *> *types;

country [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFilter(py)country]

Deprecated
country property is deprecated in favor of countries [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter.html#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFilter(py)countries].

DEPRECATED. The country to restrict results to. This should be a ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 country code
(case insensitive). If nil, no country filtering will take place.

NOTE: Ignored if the “countries” property is set.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, copy, nullable) NSString *country;

countries [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFilter(py)countries]

The countries to restrict results to. This should be a ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 country code (case
insensitive). Supports up to 5 countries to filter. If nil, no country filtering will take place.

NOTE: Overrides the deprecated “country” property if that is set.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, copy, nullable) NSArray<NSString *> *countries;

origin [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFilter(py)origin]

The straight line distance origin location for measuring the straight line distance between the
origin location and autocomplete predictions.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, nullable) CLLocation *origin;

locationBias [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFilter(py)locationBias]

The optional location bias to prefer place results near the location.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, nullable) id<GMSPlaceLocationBias [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSPlaceLocationBias.html]> locationBias;

locationRestriction [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFilter(py)locationRestriction]

The optional location restriction to limit place results.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, nullable) id<GMSPlaceLocationRestriction [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Protocols/GMSPlaceLocationRestriction.html]> locationRestriction;

regionCode [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFilter(py)regionCode]

regionCode affects address formatting, result ranking, and potentially hiding or showing certain
results.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic, nullable) NSString *regionCode;

inputOffset [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFilter(py)inputOffset]

inputOffset is the character offset of the input that indicates where the

completions may start from.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) int32_t inputOffset;

shouldIncludePureServiceAreaBusinesses [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/objc/Classes/GMSAutocompleteFilter#/c:objc(cs)GMSAutocompleteFilter(py)shouldIncludePureServiceAreaBusinesses]

Whether pure service area businesses should be included in the results.

A pure service area business is a business that visits or delivers to customers
directly but does not serve customers at their business address. For
example, businesses like cleaning services or plumbers. Those businesses
do not have a physical address or location on Google Maps. Places will not
return fields including location, plusCode, and other location related
fields for these businesses.

Default value is false.

Declaration

Swift
Objective-C
@property (nonatomic) BOOL shouldIncludePureServiceAreaBusinesses;
