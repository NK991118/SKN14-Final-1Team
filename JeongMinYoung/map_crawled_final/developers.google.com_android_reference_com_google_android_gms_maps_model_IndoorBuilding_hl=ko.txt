public final class IndoorBuilding extends Object [https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Object.html]

Represents a building.
Two IndoorBuildings are .equal() if the physical building they represent is the same.
However, if a building's structural model changes, e.g., due to an update to Google's
building models, then an old IndoorBuilding object and a new IndoorBuilding object will be
.equal(), but might have different contents.

of the level that is currently active in this building (default if no active level was
previously set).

public int getDefaultLevelIndex ()

Gets the index in the list returned by getLevels() [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/IndoorBuilding#getLevels()]
of the default level for this building.
