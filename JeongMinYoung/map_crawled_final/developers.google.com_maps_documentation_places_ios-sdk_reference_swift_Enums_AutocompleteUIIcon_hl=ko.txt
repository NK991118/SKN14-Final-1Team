AutocompleteUIIcon

enum AutocompleteUIIcon
extension AutocompleteUIIcon : Copyable, Equatable, Escapable, Hashable

The icon to display in placeAutocomplete or basicPlaceAutocomplete.

==(_:_:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/AutocompleteUIIcon#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift18AutocompleteUIIconO2eeoiySbAC_ACtFZ]

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether two values are equal.

Equality is the inverse of inequality. For any values a and b,
a == b implies that a != b is false.

Declaration

Swift
static func == (a: AutocompleteUIIcon, b: AutocompleteUIIcon) -> Bool

defaultIcon [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/AutocompleteUIIcon#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift18AutocompleteUIIconO11defaultIconyA2CmF]

Declaration

Swift
case defaultIcon

hash(into:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/AutocompleteUIIcon#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift18AutocompleteUIIconO4hash4intoys6HasherVz_tF]

Hashes the essential components of this value by feeding them into the
given hasher.

Implement this method to conform to the Hashable protocol. The
components used for hashing must be the same as the components compared
in your type’s == operator implementation. Call hasher.combine(_:)
with each of these components.

Important
In your implementation of hash(into:),
don’t call finalize() on the hasher instance provided,
or replace it with a different instance.
Doing so may become a compile-time error in the future.

Declaration

Swift
func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher)

hashValue [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/AutocompleteUIIcon#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift18AutocompleteUIIconO9hashValueSivp]

The hash value.

Hash values are not guaranteed to be equal across different executions of
your program. Do not save hash values to use during a future execution.

Important
hashValue is deprecated as a Hashable requirement. To
conform to Hashable, implement the hash(into:) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/reference/swift/Enums/AutocompleteUIIcon.html#/s:17GooglePlacesSwift18AutocompleteUIIconO4hash4intoys6HasherVz_tF] requirement instead.
The compiler provides an implementation for hashValue for you.
