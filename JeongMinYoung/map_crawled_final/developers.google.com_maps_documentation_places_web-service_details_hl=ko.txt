유럽 경제 지역 (EEA) 개발자

청구서 수신 주소가 유럽 경제 지역에 있는 경우 2025년 7월 8일부터 서비스 사용 시 Google Maps Platform EEA 서비스 약관 [https://cloud.google.com/terms/maps-platform/eea?hl=ko]이 적용됩니다. 기능은 리전에 따라 다릅니다.
자세히 알아보기 [https://developers.google.com/maps/comms/eea/faq?hl=ko]

참고: 서버 측 및 클라이언트 측 라이브러리

Places API는 Google 지도 서비스용 Java 클라이언트, Python 클라이언트, Go 클라이언트, Node.js 클라이언트 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/client-library?hl=ko]에서도 사용할 수 있습니다.
Places API 및 클라이언트 라이브러리는 서버 애플리케이션에서 사용하기 위한 것입니다.

클라이언트 측 애플리케이션을 빌드하는 경우 Android용 Places SDK (신규) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk?hl=ko], iOS용 Places SDK (신규) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk?hl=ko], 장소 라이브러리, Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places?hl=ko]를 살펴보세요.

장소 검색에서 place_id를 가져온 후 장소 세부정보 (기존) 요청을 시작하여 특정 시설 또는 관심 장소에 관한 자세한 정보를 요청할 수 있습니다. 장소 세부정보 (기존) 요청은 전체 주소, 전화번호, 사용자 평점, 리뷰 등 지정된 장소에 대한 포괄적인 정보를 반환합니다.

장소 세부정보 (기존) 요청

장소 세부정보 (기존) 요청은 다음 형식의 HTTP URL입니다.

https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/output?parameters

여기서 output는 다음 값 중 하나일 수 있습니다.

json (권장)는 JavaScript 객체 표기법 (JSON)으로 출력을 나타냅니다.
xml: XML로 출력함

검색 요청을 시작하기 위해서는 특정 매개변수가 필요합니다. URL에서와 마찬가지로 모든 매개변수는 앰퍼샌드(&) 문자를 사용하여 구분합니다. 다음은 매개변수 및 가능한 값의 목록입니다.

Required parametersplace_id
A textual identifier that uniquely identifies a place, returned from a
Place Search [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search?hl=ko]. For more information about place IDs, see the
place ID overview [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id?hl=ko].
Optional parametersfields
Caution: Place Search requests and Place Details requests do not return
the same fields. Place Search requests return a subset of the fields that
are returned by Place Details requests. If the field you want is not
returned by Place Search, you can use Place Search to get a
place_id, then use that Place ID to make a Place Details
request. For more information on the fields that are unavailable in a
Place Search request, see
Places API fields support [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-data-fields?hl=ko#places-api-fields-support].

Use the fields parameter to specify a comma-separated list of place data
types to return. For example:
fields=formatted_address,name,geometry. Use a forward slash
when specifying compound values. For example:
opening_hours/open_now.

Fields are divided into three billing categories: Basic, Contact, and
Atmosphere. Basic fields are billed at base rate, and incur no additional
charges. Contact and Atmosphere fields are billed at a higher rate. See
the
pricing sheet [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing/?hl=ko]
for more information. Attributions, html_attributions, are
always returned with every call, regardless of whether the field has been
requested.
Basic
The Basic category includes the following fields:
address_components, adr_address,
business_status, formatted_address,
geometry, icon, icon_mask_base_uri,
icon_background_color, name,
permanently_closed (deprecated [https://developers.google.com/maps/deprecations?hl=ko]), photo, place_id, plus_code,
type, url, utc_offset,
vicinity, wheelchair_accessible_entrance.
Contact
The Contact category includes the following fields:
current_opening_hours, formatted_phone_number,
international_phone_number, opening_hours,
secondary_opening_hours, websiteAtmosphere
The Atmosphere category includes the following fields:
curbside_pickup, delivery, dine_in,
editorial_summary, price_level,
rating, reservable, reviews,
serves_beer, serves_breakfast,
serves_brunch, serves_dinner,
serves_lunch, serves_vegetarian_food,
serves_wine, takeout,
user_ratings_total.
languageThe language in which to return results.
See the
list of supported languages [https://developers.google.com/maps/faq?hl=ko#languagesupport]. Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be
exhaustive.

If language is not supplied, the API attempts to use the
preferred language as specified in the
Accept-Language header.

The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for
both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street
addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by
the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other
addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are
all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first
component.

If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the
closest match.

The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that
the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The
geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language,
such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be
valid in one language but not in another. For example, utca and
tér are synonyms for street in Hungarian.
region
The region code, specified as a
ccTLD ("top-level domain") [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains#Country_code_top-level_domains]
two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes,
with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is
"uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the
entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland").

reviews_no_translations

Specify reviews_no_translations=true to disable translation
of reviews; specify reviews_no_translations=false to enable
translation of reviews. Reviews are returned in their original language.

If omitted, or passed with no value, translation of reviews is enabled. If
the language parameter was specified in the request, use the
specified language as the preferred language for translation. If
language is omitted, the API attempts to use the
Accept-Language header as the preferred language.
reviews_sort
The sorting method to use when returning reviews. Can be set to
most_relevant (default) or newest.

For most_relevant (default), reviews are sorted by
relevance; the service will bias the results to return reviews
originally written in the preferred language.

For newest, reviews are sorted in chronological order; the
preferred language does not affect the sort order.

Google recommends that you display how the reviews are being sorted to the
end user.
sessiontoken
A random string which identifies an autocomplete
session [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details?hl=ko#session_tokens]
for billing purposes.

The session begins when the user starts typing a query, and concludes when
they select a place and a call to Place Details is made. Each session can
have multiple queries, followed by one place selection. The API key(s)
used for each request within a session must belong to the same Google
Cloud Console project. Once a session has concluded, the token is no
longer valid; your app must generate a fresh token for each session. If
the sessiontoken parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a
session token, the session is charged as if no session token was provided
(each request is billed separately).
We recommend the following guidelines:Use session tokens for all autocomplete sessions.
Generate a fresh token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is
recommended.

Ensure that the API key(s) used for all Place Autocomplete and Place
Details requests within a session belong to the same Cloud Console
project.

Be sure to pass a unique session token for each new session. Using the
same token for more than one session will result in each request being
billed individually.

경고: 요청에 필드를 한 개 이상 지정하지 않거나 요청에서 fields 매개변수를 생략하면 가능한 모든 필드가 반환되며 그에 따라 요금이 청구됩니다. 이는 장소 세부정보 (기존) 요청에만 적용됩니다.

장소 세부정보 (기존) 예

다음 예에서는 place_id를 사용하여 장소 세부정보를 요청하고 name, rating, formatted_phone_number 필드를 포함합니다.

--- 탭: URL [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/legacy/details?hl=ko#url] [None] ---
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json
?fields=name%2Crating%2Cformatted_phone_number
&place_id=ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4
&key=YOUR_API_KEY

--- 탭: cURL [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/legacy/details?hl=ko#curl] [None] ---
curl -L -X GET 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json?place_id=ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4&fields=name%2Crating%2Cformatted_phone_number&key=YOUR_API_KEY'

이 예시의 키를 자체 API 키로 바꿔야 요청이 애플리케이션에서 작동합니다.

장소 세부정보 (기존) 응답

장소 세부정보 (기존) 응답은 요청의 URL 경로 내에 있는 output 플래그로 표시된 형식으로 반환됩니다.

--- 탭: JSON [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/legacy/details?hl=ko#json] [None] ---
