public     class
MapView
extends FrameLayout

A View which displays a map (with data obtained from the Google Maps service). When focused, it
will capture keypresses and touch gestures to move the map.
Users of this class must forward all the life cycle methods from the Activity [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html] or
Fragment [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html] containing this view to the corresponding ones in this class. In
particular, you must forward on the following methods:

onCreate(Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)]
onStart() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onStart()]
onResume() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onResume()]
onPause() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onPause()]
onStop() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onStop()]
onDestroy() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onDestroy()]
onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle)]
onLowMemory() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onLowMemory()]

A GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap] must be acquired using getMapAsync(OnMapReadyCallback) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#getMapAsync(com.google.android.gms.maps.OnMapReadyCallback)]. The
MapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView] automatically initializes the maps system and the view.
For a simpler method of displaying a Map use MapFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapFragment] (or SupportMapFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportMapFragment]) if you are looking to target earlier platforms.
Note: You are advised not to add children to this view.
