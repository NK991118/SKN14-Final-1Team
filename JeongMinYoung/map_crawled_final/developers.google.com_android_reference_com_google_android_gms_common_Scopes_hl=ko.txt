Constants

APP_STATE

public static final String [https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String.html] APP_STATE [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/Scopes#APP_STATE()] = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/appstate"
Scope for using the App State service.

CLOUD_SAVE

public static final String [https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String.html] CLOUD_SAVE [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/Scopes#CLOUD_SAVE()] = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastoremobile"
Scope for using the CloudSave service.

DRIVE_APPFOLDER

public static final String [https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String.html] DRIVE_APPFOLDER [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/Scopes#DRIVE_APPFOLDER()] = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata"
Scope for accessing appfolder files from Google Drive.

DRIVE_FILE

public static final String [https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String.html] DRIVE_FILE [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/Scopes#DRIVE_FILE()] = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file"
Scope for access user-authorized files from Google Drive.

EMAIL

public static final String [https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String.html] EMAIL [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/Scopes#EMAIL()] = "email"
OAuth 2.0 scope for accessing user's Google account email address.

GAMES

public static final String [https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String.html] GAMES [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/Scopes#GAMES()] = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/games"
Scope for accessing data from Google Play Games.

PLUS_LOGIN

public static final String [https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String.html] PLUS_LOGIN [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/Scopes#PLUS_LOGIN()] = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login"
This field is deprecated.
We recommend switching to PROFILE [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/Scopes#PROFILE()] scope to get the one-tap sign-in experience. See Getting Profile Information [https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/people]. Your app will get much higher sign-in completion rate by switching to profile scopes because of the streamlined user experience. And your existing users with PLUS_LOGIN grant will not be asked to sign-in again.
If you really need user's age range and locale information (which is the only additional information you can get from PLUS_LOGIN as of September 2016), use below scopes in addition to PROFILE:

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/profile.agerange.read
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/profile.language.read

See also Android Plus API Deprecation Notes [https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/android/api-deprecation].
OAuth 2.0 scope for accessing the user's name, basic profile info and Google+ profile info.
When using this scope, your app will have access to:

the user's full name, profile picture, Google+ profile ID, age range, and language
any other publicly available information on the user's Google+ profile

PLUS_ME

public static final String [https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String.html] PLUS_ME [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/Scopes#PLUS_ME()] = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.me"
This scope was previously named PLUS_PROFILE.
When using this scope, it does the following:

It lets you know who the currently authenticated user is by letting you replace a Google+ user ID with "me", which represents the authenticated user, in any call to the Google+ API.

PROFILE

public static final String [https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/String.html] PROFILE [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/Scopes#PROFILE()] = "profile"
OAuth 2.0 scope for viewing a user's basic profile information.
