public class MapFragment extends Fragment [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html]

A Map component in an app. This fragment is the simplest way to place a map in an
application. It's a wrapper around a view of a map to automatically handle the necessary life
cycle needs. Being a fragment, this component can be added to an activity's layout file
simply with the XML below.
<fragment
class="com.google.android.gms.maps.MapFragment"
android:layout_width="match_parent"
android:layout_height="match_parent"/>A GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap] must be
acquired using getMapAsync(OnMapReadyCallback) [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapFragment#getMapAsync(com.google.android.gms.maps.OnMapReadyCallback)]. This class automatically initializes the maps
system and the view.
A view can be removed when the MapFragment's onDestroyView() [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapFragment#onDestroyView()]
method is called and the GoogleMapOptions.useViewLifecycleInFragment(boolean) [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMapOptions#useViewLifecycleInFragment(boolean)] option is set. When this
happens the MapFragment is no longer valid until the view is recreated again later when the
MapFragment's onCreateView(LayoutInflater, ViewGroup, Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapFragment#onCreateView(android.view.LayoutInflater,%20android.view.ViewGroup,%20android.os.Bundle)] method is called.
Any objects obtained from the GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap] are
associated with the view. It's important to not hold on to objects (e.g. Marker [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker]) beyond
the view's life. Otherwise it will cause a memory leak as the view cannot be released.
Use this class only if you are targeting API 12 and above. Otherwise, use
SupportMapFragment by adding the Android support library to your build path.

Public Constructors

public MapFragment ()

Creates a map fragment. This constructor is public only for use by an inflater. Use
newInstance() [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapFragment#newInstance()]
to create a MapFragment programmatically.

Public Methods

public void getMapAsync (OnMapReadyCallback [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/OnMapReadyCallback]

Sets a callback object which will be triggered when the GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap]
instance is ready to be used.
Note that:

This method must be called from the main thread.
The callback will be executed in the main thread.
In the case where Google Play services is not installed on the user's device, the
callback will not be triggered until the user installs it.
In the rare case where the GoogleMap is destroyed immediately after creation, the
callback is not triggered.
The GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap]
object provided by the callback is non-null.

Parameters
| callback | The callback object that will be triggered when the map is ready to be used. Must not be null. |
