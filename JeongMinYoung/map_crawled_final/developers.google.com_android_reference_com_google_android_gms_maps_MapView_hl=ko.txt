public class MapView extends FrameLayout [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/FrameLayout.html]

A View which displays a map (with data obtained from the Google Maps service). When
focused, it will capture keypresses and touch gestures to move the map.
Users of this class must forward all the life cycle methods from the Activity [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html] or
Fragment [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html] containing
this view to the corresponding ones in this class. In particular, you must forward on the
following methods:

onCreate(Bundle) [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onCreate(android.os.Bundle)]
onStart() [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onStart()]
onResume() [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onResume()]
onPause() [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onPause()]
onStop() [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onStop()]
onDestroy() [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onDestroy()]
View.onSaveInstanceState() [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#onSaveInstanceState()]
onLowMemory() [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#onLowMemory()]

A GoogleMap [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap] must be
acquired using getMapAsync(OnMapReadyCallback) [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView#getMapAsync(com.google.android.gms.maps.OnMapReadyCallback)]. The MapView [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView]
automatically initializes the maps system and the view.
For a simpler method of displaying a Map use MapFragment [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapFragment] (or
SupportMapFragment [https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportMapFragment])
if you are looking to target earlier platforms.
Note: You are advised not to add children to this view.
