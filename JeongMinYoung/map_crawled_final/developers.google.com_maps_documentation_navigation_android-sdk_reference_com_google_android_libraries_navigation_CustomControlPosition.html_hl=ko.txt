CustomControlPosition

BOTTOM_END_BELOW

Elements are positioned in the bottom end corner of the map. The end edge of the custom control
is aligned with the end edge of the visible map area and the bottom edge is aligned with the
bottom of the visible map area. The size of the control is unconstrained and it may overlap
with elements at the top or start of the view if it is very large.

BOTTOM_START_BELOW

The custom control is positioned in the bottom start (i.e. left in LTR layouts) corner of the
map below the re-center button and Google logo. The start edge of the custom control is aligned
with the start edge of the visible map area and the bottom edge is aligned with the bottom of
the visible map area. The size of the control is unconstrained and it may overlap with elements
at the top or end of the view if it is very large.

FOOTER

Preview [https://developers.google.com/maps/launch-stages#preview] feature
The custom control is positioned above the ETA card with bottom edge aligned with top edge
of the ETA card. If ETA card is not enabled, the bottom of the view is aligned with the bottom
edge of the map. Adding additional custom control elements will position those elements above
this element. The custom control spans full width in portrait orientation and half width in
landscape orientation.

SECONDARY_HEADER

Elements are positioned below the primary map header, with top edge aligned with bottom edge of
the primary header. The default secondary header (then arrow/lan guidance) will be hidden if a
view is added at this position. Adding a view at this position is only supported in portrait
mode. Trying to do so in landscape mode won't have any effect.
