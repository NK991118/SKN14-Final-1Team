September 22, 2023
5.0.0

Due to downstream dependencies affected by a Kotlin version upgrade, the adoption of future version v5.1.0 will require some migration effort if your project uses Kotlin.

We recommend you upgrade to Kotlin v1.9.0+ as soon as possible to minimize friction of adopting future features or bug fixes in the Navigation SDK for Android. If you build your application using Kotlin, update to Kotlin version 1.9.0 in your project-level build.gradle file (both Kotlin stdlib and Kotlin Gradle Plugin).

Review our resources for upgrading Kotlin language versions:

If you are migrating from Kotlin 1.6 or 1.7, follow the migration [https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding/migration] guide if your app uses Kotlin synthetics
Use the compatibility guide for Kotlin 1.9 [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/compatibility-guide-19.html] to understand differences between 1.8 and 1.9
Ensure the Gradle/Android Gradle plugin versions are in the range [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/gradle-configure-project.html#apply-the-plugin] defined by Kotlin Gradle plugin version 1.9.0

Announcement: Freezing support for Android 5 (July 21, 2022)

For our latest SDK version (v4.1.2 and the later versions in v4.x), we are
providing an additional year of support for apps running on Android 5, for both
API levels 21 and 22.

What this means:

Navigation SDK and Driver SDK running on your Android apps will support a
minimum Android 5 (API level 21) until June 30, 2023.
After June 30, 2023, we will support only Android API levels 23 and above.
In other words, we will stop supporting Android API levels 21 and 22 across
all SDK versions after that date. This means that bugs related to Android 21
or 22 in any SDK version (including 4.x) will not be fixed, and we do not
guarantee that the SDKs will behave correctly.

This notice overrides the Android 21 and 22 support freezing notice from June
21, 2021, and the Android 23, 24, and 25 support freezing from October 18, 2021.

Version 4.2.2 (September 8, 2022)

Stability and Bug Fixes

Fixes a gRPC crash where io.grpc.util.SecretRoundRobinLoadBalancerProvider$Provider
cannot be instantiated. The error frequently surfaced for apps depending on
com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore alongside Navigation SDK for Android.

Version 4.2.1 (August 17, 2022)

Stability and Bug Fixes

Fixes a null pointer issue when processing deferred map click events.
Fixes a null pointer issue in GoogleMap.setMyLocationEnabled [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#setMyLocationEnabled(boolean)].

Version 4.2.0 (July 01, 2022)

API changes

Provides the ability to expose the trip to ferry segments.

Stability and Bug Fixes

Fixes a memory leak in Marker.setIcon [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker#public-void-seticon-bitmapdescriptor-icondescriptor].
Fixes issue where GoogleMap.setPadding [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#public-void-setpadding-int-left,-int-top,-int-right,-int-bottom] was not working.
Updates all dependencies.

Version 4.1.4 (June 23, 2022)

Bug Fixes

Some customers experienced a NoSuchFieldError for style
mod_text_appearance_headline7 on confirmation popups. This patch replaces
the missing style and eliminates references to the missing style in the
Navigation SDK artifacts.

Version 4.1.3 (May 25, 2022)

Bug Fixes

Fixes padding for the Google logo, compass, and the camera. Previously, these were not respecting the padding set by GoogleMap.setPadding().

Version 4.1.2 (May 20, 2022)

API changes

Downgrades the minimum Android API level for the Navigation SDK to 21.

Version 4.1.1 (March 29, 2022)

Bug Fixes

Some clients received a Terms of Service dialog error when the Android Activity was destroyed. Now clients will not longer experience this dialog error when an activity is destroyed.
Fixes a broken hyperlink in the Terms of Service dialog.
Previously, the progress bar was only visible in portrait mode. It is now visible in landscape mode as well..
The progress bar remains visible throughout navigation - even when camera is not in follow mode, and user is interacting with the map.

Version 4.1 (March 2, 2022)

API Changes

Introduces the setTripProgressBarEnabled method on
SupportNavigationFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SupportNavigationFragment#setTripProgressBarEnabled(boolean)].
Previously, this method was only available on the NavigationView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#setTripProgressBarEnabled(boolean)].
See Trip Progress Bar [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/controls#trip-progress-bar] for more information.
Introduces the StreetView APIs into the Navigation SDK. The primary
entry-points are the SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment],
StreetViewPanoramaFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaFragment]
and StreetViewPanoramaView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/StreetViewPanoramaView],
just as they are in Google Maps SDK for Android. To get started using
StreetView within the Navigation SDK, view the
corresponding documentation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/streetview#use_the_api].
Then see the "GoogleMap Demo" [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/try-demo]
to understand how the APIs are integrated in the sample app.
Introduces the setNavigationUiEnabled method on NavigationView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#setNavigationUiEnabled(boolean)]
and SupportNavigationFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SupportNavigationFragment#setNavigationUiEnabled(boolean)].
These methods allow you to switch between a "map-focused" and
"navigation-focused" user-experience in your UI. These methods may take effect
asynchronously; e.g. if the Navigator [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator]
has not been created yet, the requested setting will not be honored right
away. We recommend registering the OnNavigationUiChangedListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/OnNavigationUiChangedListener]
to be informed when the requested setting for setNavigationUiEnabled has
been honored by the UI.
Deprecates the setLocationMarkerEnabled API on NavigationView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView#setLocationMarkerEnabled(boolean)]
and SupportNavigationFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SupportNavigationFragment#setLocationMarkerEnabled(boolean)]
in favor of a newly-added method, GoogleMap.setMyLocationEnabled [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#setMyLocationEnabled(boolean)].
You can also register the GoogleMap.OnMyLocationClickListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap.OnMyLocationClickListener]
to react to click events on the location marker.
Adds the method GoogleMap.getMyLocation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#getMyLocation()]
and the related listener GoogleMap.OnMyLocationChangeListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap.OnMyLocationChangeListener].
These methods are already deprecated in the Google Maps APIs,
but we supply them for your convenience and to ease the migration from the
Google Maps APIs.

Bug Fixes

Updates the error-handling for the CustomRoutesOptions.Builder [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/CustomRoutesOptions.Builder]
to be more informative when a malformed route token is passed in.
Handles an edge-case from Android framework with respect to the lifecycle of
the navigation service.

Sample App Changes

Starting Navigation SDK v4.1, sample apps for the SDK are now
released independently of the SDK artifact. Both can be found in the shared
Google Drive [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FLR7wtNgLlbn0nThbLMIMtoRzt4bGOwk], but they will no longer be bundled into
the same .zip file.
The existing sample app, now called the "GoogleNavigation Demo" has been
revamped significantly. Now, you can test a number of Navigation APIs at
runtime (instead of having to recompile) with the new customization overlays.
Also, the sample app build variants have been consolidated into one target.
A new sample app, the "GoogleMap Demo", has been added. This sample app
demonstrates many of the behaviors developers are familiar with from the
Google Maps APIs. The primary difference is the presence of a toggle
button that switches the inflated view-variant between the MapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView]
and the NavigationView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/NavigationView],
where applicable.
For more information, view the Getting Started [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/get_started]
page.

Version 4.0.3 (April 1, 2022)

Bug fixes

Fixes a broken hyperlink in the Terms of Service dialog.
Previously, the progress bar was only visible in portrait mode. It is now visible in landscape mode as well.
The progress bar remains visible throughout navigation - even when camera is not in follow mode, and user is interacting with the map.

Version 4.0.2 (February 25, 2022)

Bug fixes

Some clients received a Terms of Service dialog error when the activity was
destroyed. The error has been fixed and clients will no longer experience the
error.

Version 4.0.1 (February 15, 2022)

Bug fixes

Some Android clients experienced an "Application Not Responding" (ANR) error
when the app initially loaded due to a network call that blocked the load. Now,
app initialization should proceed without issue.

Version 4.0 (December 14, 2021)

API changes

Bumps the minimum Android API level for the Navigation SDK to 23, and bumps
the target API level to 30. This target version is in-line with the
Google Play requirements [https://developer.android.com/google/play/requirements/target-sdk].
Adds the MapView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView],
MapFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapFragment] and
SupportMapFragment [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/SupportMapFragment] classes. Customers may
find these classes useful in helping to transition off of the Maps SDK when
migrating from v1 to v4.
Adds an API that enables a Trip Progress Bar [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/release-notes/custom_v2#trip-progress-bar].
It displays a progress bar that lets drivers see the upcoming traffic along their
route.

Note: The Trip Progress Bar is visible only in portrait mode.

Updates the sample app [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/try-demo]
to pull the Navigation SDK for Android artifact using the Maven artifact
repository where it is housed. Previously, the sample app was built against the
local .aar artifact.
Renders the polyline that trails the navigation chevron in the color "gray" to
indicate that the user has already driven through that section of the route.

Stability and bug fixes

Fixes a ConcurrentModificationException that arises from certain usage
patterns of the arrival listener.

Version 3.2.1 (December 16, 2021)

Stability and bug fixes

Fixes a crash that happens when navigation starts on Android API Level < 21.
Fixes a ConcurrentModificationException that arises from certain usage
patterns of the arrival listener.

Announcement (October 18, 2021)

Freezing support for API Level 23, 24 and 25
Caution: This announcement has been revoked. Please see an updated announcement on
July 21, 2022 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/release-notes#announcement_july_21_2022].

Read revoked announcement
In response to changes in our internal dependencies, Android API Level 23,
24, and 25 (Android 6, 7.0 and 7.1) will not be supported in new versions of the
Navigation and Driver SDKs for Android, beginning in the third
quarter of 2022.

Navigation and Driver SDKs for Android versions released beginning in the third
quarter of 2022 will only support devices running a minimum of
Android API Level 26.

App versions built with v3.x or lower of the Navigation and Driver SDKs for
Android will continue to work on devices running Android API Level 25 and below.

Version 3.2 (October 07, 2021)

API changes

Expose zoom control and indoor APIs from maps SDK.
Update attribute in GoogleMapOptions to specify the background color for the view which can be specified in the Android Manifest XML file for an Android app or programmatically during initialization.

Stability and bug fixes

Fixes a potential memory leak issue.
Fixes a bug that was producing ANR issues.
Prevents a crash originated by the Terms of Service dialog.

Deprecations

Deprecates Navigator#setDestinations with route token in favor of a new API that uses the new CustomRoutesOptions class.

** New Features **

Adds 2-Wheeler support for Custom Routes.

Version 3.1.3 (September 27, 2021)

Stability and bug fixes

The Navigation SDK for Android UI now automatically surfaces visual cues,
like a greyed out location-marker and a “Searching for GPS” callout. This
visual change occurs when the last-valid location becomes somewhat stale, and
will automatically revert when the SDK receives new valid location updates.

Version 3.1.2 (September 17, 2021)

API changes

EXPERIMENTAL: Added a new API, GpsAvailabilityEnhancedLocationListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/RoadSnappedLocationProvider.GpsAvailabilityEnhancedLocationListener],
that allows developers to listen to transitions in the GPS availability on the
device.

This API is experimental, which means it is subject to removal or breaking
changes in future releases. Please exercise discretion before adoption.

Version 3.1.1 (July 26, 2021)

Stability and bug fixes

Fixes an IllegalStateException associated with an overly restrictive
preconditions check in implementation code.
Fixes a NullPointerException when panning to a screen location that cannot
be translated into a geographic location.

Version 3.1.0 (June 23, 2021)

API changes

Speeding listeners are now supported in headless navigation. This makes it
possible to monitor speeding without first rendering a View or a Fragment
from the Navigation SDK.

Deprecation announcement (June 21, 2021)

This announcement describes deprecations to the Navigation SDK for Android
and Driver SDK for Android as of the date listed above.
This announcement was also sent out as a Mandatory Service Announcement (MSA)
to affected customers.

Navigation SDK for Android and Driver SDK for Android v1.x deprecation

Nav/Driver SDK v1 was released in 2018, and with our v3 versions soon to be
released, it’s time to deprecate v1 to avoid the unsustainability of
supporting many major versions.

The time saved by not having to support this additional version will allow
us to better support the latest major version and build more features that
are important to our customers.

Thus, Nav/Driver SDK v1.x is now deprecated and will no longer be maintained
after June 21, 2022.

Please take a moment to see
how deprecations in SDK versions work [https://developers.google.com/maps/deprecations#deprecation_in_sdk_versions].

Navigation and Driver SDK Android 21 and 22 end of support
Caution: This announcement has been revoked. Please see an updated announcement on
July 21, 2022 [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/release-notes#announcement_july_21_2022].

Read revoked announcement
The upcoming v4.0 of Navigation SDK for Android and
Driver SDK for Android will support a minimum
[Android 6.0 (API level 23)](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platforms#6.0){: .external}.
The current minimum supported version is Android 5.0 (API level 21).
We forecast releasing v4.0 in Q4 2021. This means:

App versions built with versions earlier than v4.x will continue to work on
Android 21 and 22 devices. Your driver apps that have integrated our
current SDKs will continue to work on devices running Android 21+.
This is the same as before.
App versions built with Driver SDK for Android and
Navigation SDK for Android v4.x (targeted for
Q4 2021, subject to change) and after won’t be able to be installed on
devices running Android 21 and 22. v4.x will run on minimum Android 6.0 (API level 23),
so versions of your app built with the forthcoming v4.x can only be
received by drivers with devices that have Android 23+. To reiterate,
this means that both our SDK-related changes and any app changes you’ve
made won’t reach drivers with devices running Android 21 and 22.

The versions of Navigation SDK for Android v3 and
Driver SDK for Android v3 that you will want to upgrade to
are explained in the following table along with when they’ll be available.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |

To continue using the removed methods, you may stay on v1.x, but without
expectation of support or maintenance after June 21, 2022 (see next section).

We recommend you migrate to v3.x. This means:

The last release of v1.x will occur on Q4 2021 (and thus v1 is
“feature frozen” from then).
This last release can be patched for 6 months thereafter, until June 21, 2022.
After this time, we will not be able to respond to bug or feature requests
for v1.x.

Please take a moment to review the following table and the
[migration guide](/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/migration) in
order to help you navigate these changes.

What can I do by when?

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |

We’d recommend that you notify your drivers with devices on Android 21 and 22
to upgrade to a newer version of Android (minimum Android 6.0) before you
integrate Driver SDK for Android and Navigation SDK for Android
version v4.x and above into your driver app.

Version 3.0.1 (May 20, 2021)

Stability and bug fixes

Fixed a crash in followMyLocation().
Fixed "Metadata key must not be null" NullPointerException.

Version 3.0 (May 10, 2021)

The Driver SDK for Android has been decoupled from the
Navigation SDK for Android, and the two SDKs will be delivered as separate
binaries on separate maintenance schedules. This change was done to make
Driver SDK updates easier to test and integrate for
customers. More details and guidance:

Navigation SDK usage is the same for version 2.x and version 3.0.
FleetEngine.java is in the Driver SDK AAR.
Driver SDK users should pick up
Driver SDK version 3.0 from Maven
(when available [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/transportation-logistics/on-demand-rides-deliveries-solution/support/relnotes_driver_sdk_android])
and specify the 3.x version of Navigation SDK they wish to use.

New features

The TurnByTurn SDK [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/tbt-feed] lets you provide small-screen users,
such as two-wheeled vehicle riders,
with navigation information and visual cues such as upcoming maneuvers
with icons (left, right, U-turn), turn numbers in roundabouts, road names,
estimated distance and time to the next navigation step or final destination,
and navigation state (en route, rerouting, stopped).
A new attribute has been added to
GoogleMapOptions [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMapOptions]
to specify the background color for the view, which you can specify in the
Android Manifest XML file for an Android app or programmatically during
initialization.

Stability and bug fixes

Fixed a camera bug where the recenter button appeared after moving the
app to the background.

Decommissions

The following methods, which were marked deprecated in version 2.x, have been
removed:

Navigator#startGuidance(resumeIntent)
NavigationApi#initForegroundServiceManager(*)
Waypoint#fromLatLng(*)
Waypoint#fromPlaceId(*)

Version 2.7.2 (July 14, 2021)

Stability and bug fixes

Fixes an IllegalStateException associated with an overly restrictive
preconditions check in implementation code.
Fixes a NullPointerException when panning to a screen location that cannot
be translated into a geographic location.
Adjusts some internal memory management in the Navigation SDK.

Version 2.7.1 (May 19, 2021)

Stability and bug fixes

Fixed a crash in followMyLocation().
Fixed "Metadata key must not be null" NullPointerException.

Version 2.7 (April 5, 2021)

New features

Added the FollowMyLocationOptions class, which allows you to set the zoom
level during navigation. Added a
followMyLocation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/GoogleMap#public-void-followmylocation-int-perspective]
method overload that takes a FollowMyLocationOptions object as a parameter.
Added the setNavigationMapStyle method, which allows you to enable the
high detail navigation map style. The high definition navigation map style
displays 2D building outlines at zoom level 19 or higher.

Stability and bug fixes

Fixed an issue that caused the camera's recenter button to appear after an app
runs in the background.

Version 2.6 (March 15, 2021)

Added a new mandatory dependency. Add the following dependencies to your
Gradle dependency lists to avoid runtime crashes:
api 'joda-time:joda-time:2.9.9'.

New features

Updated the demo app to have a variant that stresses navigation behaviors
through SupportNavigationFragment.
Updated the demo app to showcase some additional location-following behaviors.

Stability and bug fixes

Fixed an issue where 'follow my location' mode was not canceled upon camera
movement.
Fixed an issue where the camera stops following the user's location after the
caller stops turn-by-turn guidance.
Fixed an issue where consumers of the Navigation SDK using Joda-Time run into
conflicts with the obfuscated version of jodatime which was packaged into our
library.
Fixed an issue in which the Navigation SDK accidentally hides consumer-app
notifications it does not own upon launching a navigation session.

Driver SDK

The Fleet Engine createInstance method now requires the caller to pass in a Navigator instance.
This is a breaking change, and your app will fail to compile unless you update
all relevant invocation sites in your code.
Adds methods to  Navigator to register and remove listeners for updates to
traffic data.

Version 2.5.2 (March 29, 2021)

Fixed an issue where the camera stops following the user's location after the
caller stops turn-by-turn guidance.

Version 2.5.1 (January 29, 2021)

Fixed an issue where 'follow my location' mode was not canceled upon camera
movement.

Version 2.5 (December 15, 2020)

API changes

Added two new methods to the Navigator API to allow setting and removing
listeners for new navigation sessions.
Added a new method to the Navigator API to obtain transaction IDs for the
ongoing navigation session. This API should be used when a new navigation
session starts and when the transaction IDs change in an ongoing navigation
session (e.g. when the list of journey segments is updated).

Version 2.4.1 (January 29, 2021)

Fixed an issue where 'follow my location' mode was not canceled upon camera
movement.

Version 2.4 (November 5, 2020)

Added the Navigator.ReroutingListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator.ReroutingListener]
class. Register the ReroutingListener on the Navigator instance by calling
addReroutingListener; use removeReroutingListener to unregister.
Modified the FleetEngine.createInstance class constructor, added wrappers for AuthTokenFactory [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/FleetEngine.AuthTokenFactory]
and StatusListener.
Fixed a race condition that could cause a crash under the right conditions.

Version 2.3.1 (January 26, 2021)

Fixed an issue where 'follow my location' mode was not canceled upon camera
movement.

Version 2.3 (September 18, 2020)

You can now pass a route token to NavSDK to retrieve the route represented by
that route token. The route token is associated with a route response when you
call the Routes Preferred API. The new API is
Navigator#setDestination(List<Waypoint> destinations, String routeToken) [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/v1/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Navigator#setDestination(com.google.android.libraries.navigation.Waypoint)].
Added some new mandatory dependencies. Add the following dependencies to your
Gradle dependency lists to avoid runtime crashes:
api 'com.google.android.datatransport:transport-api:2.2.0'
api 'com.google.android.datatransport:transport-backend-cct:2.2.0'
api 'com.google.android.datatransport:transport-runtime:2.2.0'

Version 2.2 (August 10, 2020)

New features

Repackaged the embedded Google Maps SDK's package name from libraries.maps
to gms.maps. To migrate, take these steps:

Change all references of com.google.android.libraries.maps to com.google.android.gms.
Update your build.gradle to exclude the Google Play Services version of the
Maps SDK for Android. See the build.gradle file in the sample app for an example.

Reintroduced the Waypoint parameter in NavigationTransactionRecorder
pickup and dropoff methods.
Added the Waypoint.Builder.setVehicleStopover [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Waypoint.Builder#setVehicleStopover(boolean)]
API that enables/disables the automatic relocation of stopovers in the route
when waypoints are set in a place where it is not possible to stop.
Added a parameter SpeedAlertSeverity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedAlertSeverity]
to the SpeedAlert callback. Use this parameter with the SpeedingListener [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/SpeedingListener].

Stability and bug fixes

Deprecated NavigationApi.cleanUp method due to unwanted side effects like
NullPointerExceptions leading to crashes.
Deprecated Waypoint.fromLatLng() and Waypoint.fromPlaceId() in favor of
Waypoint.builder() [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/reference/com/google/android/libraries/navigation/Waypoint.Builder].
Deprecated the AddressListener class, contained in the NavigationTransactionRecorder,
because it is unused.

Version 2.1 (April 9, 2020)

New features

Customizable fonts/colors/icons for the Navigation header.
Support customization of the color of the recommended lane(s) in the
Navigation Header UI.
Updates several APIs to follow the add-remove pattern for setting
callbacks/listeners. Previous set* methods have been marked deprecated and
will be removed in a future release. The deprecated methods are listed here:

SupportNavigationFragment.setOnNightModeChangedListener
SupportNavigationFragment.setOnRecenterButtonClickedListener
NavigationFragment.setOnNightModeChangedListener
NavigationFragment.setOnRecenterButtonClickedListener
NavigationView.setOnNightModeChangedListener
NavigationView.setOnRecenterButtonClickedListener
Navigator.setArrivalListener
Navigator.setRouteChangedListener
Navigator.setRemainingTimeOrDistanceChangedListener

Stability and bug fixes

Bump up the minSdkVersion for navsdk to 19.
Fixed a bug where lat/lng Waypoint names were not honored in case server-side
reverse geocoding fails.

Version 2.0 (October 15, 2019)

New features

Navigation SDK 2.0 incorporates the Maps SDK map renderer and surfaces Maps SDK
APIs. This NavSDK version enables developers to access most of the Maps API
features while navigating such as drawing polygons, overlays and polylines.
Developers can also control the map styling for navigation and have some
additional camera controls. The driver experience improves with this version as
the MapView --> Navigation switch will be instantaneous since the map is shared
across the two modes.

API changes

The following classes have been removed:

com.google.android.libraries.navigation.LatLng
com.google.android.libraries.navigation.LatLngBounds
com.google.android.libraries.navigation.Marker
com.google.android.libraries.navigation.MarkerOptions

They have been replaced by:

com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLng
com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLngBounds
com.google.android.gms.maps.model.Marker
com.google.android.gms.maps.model.MarkerOptions
